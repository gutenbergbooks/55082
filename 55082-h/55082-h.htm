<h2>THINGS THAT BRING YOU GOOD LUCK
AND BAD LUCK</h2>
</div>


<p>Ask a dozen people whether they have any superstitions, and the majority
will tell you, without hesitation, that they have not the slightest
belief in such things. If the truth is told there are very few of us who do not
cherish some little weaknesses in this direction. One person may believe in
a number of superstitions; another has, perhaps, only a few that are observed;
but he or she that has none at all is a remarkably rare individual.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, most superstitions are based on reason and sound
common sense, and the man or woman who pays heed to them is acting
intelligently, whether he or she knows it or not. Take, for instance, the
belief that it is unlucky to walk under a ladder. True, the old assertion is
that it is unlucky to do so because Jesus Christ was taken down from the
Cross by means of a ladder. But the more practical reason is that painters
and other men on ladders are very likely to drop things and, if you happen
to be passing at the time, the paintpot or the tools will fall on you.</p>

<p>Of course, the reasons for all superstitions are not so evident as this one
about walking under a ladder: nevertheless, there is a germ of reason in them
all, whether or not we know the reason. Thus, the man or woman who
observes the common superstitions of everyday life is acting wisely. Not
only will he or she avoid a good deal of trouble, but his actions will
provide him with a sense of well-being, and the effect it will have on his
mind, the psychological effect as it is called, is all to the good.</p>

<p>It is not proposed to explain why this or that superstition is worthy of
being observed; in many cases, the reason is obscure; but here we will give
some of the beliefs which are current at the present time.</p>

<p>First of all, you should never pass anybody on the stairs of a private house,
and, while talking of stairs, it may be said that many people believe that,
for someone to fall up a step, is a sign of an approaching wedding.</p>

<p>Never light three cigarettes with the same match unless you are prepared
for a spell of ill-fortune. This superstition gained currency during the War,
probably because a match held long enough to light three cigarettes would
give the enemy a clue to your position, especially at night-time.</p>

<p>If the cord of a picture frame snaps and the picture falls to the ground,
it is an omen that somebody is going to die. If the picture is a portrait
of a living person, then that person's life is the one likely to be terminated.
This omen may be considered a remarkably silly one, with not a shred of
sense to recommend it. Yet how many people can point to instances when
the prophecy has come true!</p>

<p>Of salt, there are several omens. The chief one tells you not to help anybody
to salt; in other words, it is unwise to put some on a person's plate.
Helping them to salt is helping them to sorrow. Another superstition says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that if you spill salt you will be unlucky unless you throw a pinch of it
over your left shoulder.</p>

<p>To break a mirror is known by all as a serious matter. The reason why
it is unlucky, we are told, doubtless finds its origin in a mere association
of ideas. The mirror being broken, the image of the person looking into
it is destroyed: therefore, bad luck in some form must be the fate of the
careless one. What exactly is the penalty one must pay for breaking a
mirror is not definite. Some people speak of seven years of misfortune,
while others claim that it means seven years of celibacy.</p>

<p>To take certain things into the house is the height of folly, if you believe
in superstitions. May or hawthorn blossom is one, though the berries of
this flower seem to have no ill-potency. Peacock's feathers are another.
Somewhat similar is the contention that it is very unlucky to open an
umbrella indoors.</p>

<p>While sitting at the meal-table, there are several things that must not be
done. Helping a friend to salt has been already mentioned, but you must not
allow the knives or forks to become crossed. Quarrels with your friends will
result if you do. Of course, you must not sit down, thirteen of you, around
the table. As is well known, this belief has its origin in the Last Supper,
when our Lord sat at meat with his twelve apostles. On the other hand,
should you taste a fruit for the first time in that season, you have only to
frame a wish and it will be granted. Much the same applies to mince-pies.
You will be awarded with a whole happy month for each pie that you eat at
Christmas-time which is made in a different house. Of course, it is highly
unwise for two people to pour tea out of the same pot at the same meal.</p>

<p>To give a friend an edged tool is sure to cut the friendship, whether it be
a knife, a pair of scissors, a razor or a chisel. When such a gift is to be
made, the usual plan is to sell it to your friend for a penny.</p>

<p>You should never put a shoe on a table, and, to see a pin lying on the
floor and leave it there, is an omen that you will want before you die. As
the jingle runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container-left"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">See a pin and let it lie, you're sure to want before you die.</div>
      <div class="verse">See a pin and pick it up, then you're sure to have good luck.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Elsewhere, a good deal is said about dreams. Here it will be sufficient
to mention one or two items of interest. It is decidedly unlucky to dream
of a baby, yet to dream of a funeral is lucky. The following is worth bearing
in mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container-left"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Friday dream and Saturday told;</div>
      <div class="verse">Sure to come true, if ever so old.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And here it will be appropriate to recall the fact that it is an unwise
thing to get out of bed on the wrong side. The devil will be with you all the
day, if you do.</p>

<p>You should avoid looking at the new moon through glass; but if you have
a wish that you want fulfilled, you have only to count seven stars on seven
nights in succession. Let it be said, however, that to count seven stars for
this space of time is not as simple as it appears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>It is unlucky to treasure locks of people's hair, and, should you drop a
glove, it is to your advantage if someone else picks it up for you. If the
fire refuses to light properly in the morning, anticipate a whole day with
the devil.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that one of the luckiest things that can be done is to
pick up a horse-shoe. But it is not generally known that the more nails left
in it, the better. Nor is it sufficiently well recognized that a shoe, hung up,
should have the tips pointing upwards. If they are turned down, the luck
will run out of them.</p>

<p>Naturally, you will never start anything fresh on a Friday, and you
will not cut your fingernails on a Sunday. Regarding fingernails, a poet,
of sorts, has said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Cut them on Monday, you cut them for news.</div>
      <div class="verse">Cut them on Tuesday, a new pair of shoes.</div>
      <div class="verse">Cut them on Wednesday, you cut them for health.</div>
      <div class="verse">Cut them on Thursday, you cut them for wealth.</div>
      <div class="verse">Cut them on Friday, a sweetheart you'll know.</div>
      <div class="verse">Cut them on Saturday, a journey you'll go.</div>
      <div class="verse">Cut them on Sunday, you cut them for evil:</div>
      <div class="verse">For all the next week, you'll be ruled by the devil.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Of course, bad luck has not a monopoly on your superstitions, for good
luck has something to say also. To see a piebald horse is fortunate; to find
white heather, four-leaved clover or four-leaved shamrock is even more fortunate.
To open a pea-pod and find ten peas in it is particularly lucky.
For a black cat to come into your house is worth much. To come across a
nickel with a hole in it is not without its merits, but the best thing of
all is to put on some article of clothing inside out, and to wear it all day
long, without being aware of it until bed-time.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>HAVE YOU A TALISMAN?</h2>
</div>


<p>"A person who finds a four-leaved clover, and believes it is a harbinger
of something good, has adopted the right attitude, for he keeps a keen
look-out for that particular good and holds out both hands for it. Seldom
is he disappointed, for he has unconsciously set going the mental machinery
which brings his wishes within reach. Had he not found the clover and
had gone along life's highway unexpectant of anything good, he would never
have discovered this pleasant happening. And therein lies the true psychology
of luck, which seems too simple to be true, but then its simplicity
is really the sign-manual of its verity."</p>

<p>This quotation from the writings of a well-known author goes direct to
the point about talismans. If you adopt a talisman and put your faith in
it, you immediately prepare your mind for receiving an abundance of good
fortune. Reject all talismans and argue that there is no such thing as luck,
and you straightway set going the mental machinery which looks on the
dark side of things and which misses every slice of luck that comes along.
Therefore, we say, with emphasis, take to yourself a talisman, a mascot, a
charm&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;and you will never regret it.
</p>

<p>Of talismans, there are countless varieties; some are known the world
over, others are the particular choice of individuals. They range from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
amulets and scarabs of the ancients to the golliwogs and crudities of the
ultra-moderns. Your choice may roam between these two extremes, but
whatever your choice, it must be set with the seal of your faith.</p>

<p>In order to assist you in picking out a talisman for yourself, we append
the following accounts of those examples which are favored most:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>THE HORSE-SHOE.</i>&mdash;No symbol is a greater favorite than the horse-shoe.
There are many legends regarding its origin, but the most commonly
accepted concerns the well-known visit of his Satanic Majesty to the shoe-smith.
As a consequence, the Devil evinced a wholesome dread of horseshoes,
and would not go near a house or person possessing one. It is more
likely, however, that the horse-shoe was accepted as a symbol of luck because
it was a commonplace object very nearly the same shape as the metal crescents
worn by the Romans when they wanted to be fortunate. These crescents
were always carried with the horns turned up, and, if a horse-shoe is to bring
good luck, it, too, must be placed with the prongs uppermost. The reason
for the prongs being so turned depends on a belief that misfortune always
travels in circles, but when it reaches the tips of a horse-shoe, it is baffled,
unless all the luck has already run out of the tips through them being turned
downwards.</p>

<p>Of course, an old, worn shoe is more lucky than a new one, and it is
a recognized fact that the more nails found in it the luckier will be the
finder.</p>

<img src="images/i_006.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p><i>THE SCARAB.</i>&mdash;This device is accounted very lucky or very unlucky,
according to the disposition of the wearer. The symbol represents the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
scarab beetle with its wings outspread or with them closed. Such charms
are made to-day in large numbers for sale in Egypt, but those who trade in
them usually claim that each particular specimen has been in the family
since Biblical times. As a rule, the device is made in a rough kind of bluish
porcelain and is carved, in intaglio, with divine figures. The Egyptians used
to make up the scarab as a neck pendant or as a little ornament for
placing in the coffins of the dead. Its mission was to scare away the evil one.</p>

<div class="figcenter bigfig">
<img src="images/i_007.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 2.&mdash;An Egyptian Scarab, such as were used as talismen. Two forms are shown,
one with the pectoral wings outspread; the other, with wings closed.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>THE TET.</i>&mdash;This symbol was shaped somewhat like a mallet, and was
always worn with the head uppermost and the handle hanging down. It
was made in porcelain or stone, and was often colored gaudily. The Egyptians
were the first to find efficacy in this charm, and they wore it suspended
around the neck to ward off attacks from visible and invisible enemies.
Thus, it was a protection against evil in any form; it was also supposed to
provide the wearer with strength and endurance. The tet has been much
forgotten of late years, but there are adherents who value it above the horseshoe
and almost any other charm.</p>

<div class="figcenter bigfig"><a name="Page_tet" id="Page_tet"></a>
<img src="images/i_008.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 3.&mdash;The Talisman on the left is the Tet; on the right, the Arrow-Head.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>THE ARROW-HEAD.</i>&mdash;The early Britons spent a great deal of their
time in taking suitable flints and shaping them into the form of triangles.
These were called arrow-heads, and when the two side edges had been
sharpened they were fixed into sticks and used as weapons or tools. Out
of this use grew the idea that arrow-heads were potent charms in providing
bodily protection against enemy force or the usual illnesses. Accordingly,
people began to wear them as neck ornaments and, for this purpose, decorative
arrow-heads were made. Ever since then, they have been cherished
for their powers in warding off attacks, and a superstition still exists which
claims that if one of these arrow-heads is dipped in water, the water will be
more potent than any doctor's medicine.</p>

<p><i>THE CADUCEUS.</i>&mdash;This device, which figures as part of the design of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
some postage stamps, has been considered a bringer of good fortune ever since
the time of the ancient Greeks. It consists of two snakes entwining a rod,
surmounted by a pine cone. By the side of the cone is a pair of wings. It
was the symbol of Mercury. The rod had the supernatural powers of
quelling disputes and letting people dwell in harmony. The snakes possessed
the property of healing; the pine cone preserved good health; and the wings
stood for speed and progress. Thus people wear the caduceus today in order
to ensure a life free from quarrels and illness, and to enable them to be
healthy and "go ahead."</p>

<div class="figcenter bigfig"><a name="Page_staff" id="Page_staff"></a>
<img src="images/i_009.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 4.&mdash;The Caduceus or Staff of Mercury.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>THE EYE AGATE.</i>&mdash;As is generally appreciated, the "evil eye" is the
source of all trouble and misfortunes, and the early Eastern races thought
that, if the "evil eye" could be avoided or frightened away, all would be well.
Searching for a charm to effect their purpose, they alighted upon the eye agate,
and this they believed would give no quarter to the "evil eye." Accordingly,
agates were cut to resemble an eye which would be powerful enough to
neutralize the effects of the evil one, and these were worn as brooches, rings
and necklaces. The agate chosen for the purpose consisted of thin layers
of stone of various colors. Thus, by cutting the stones oval and removing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
parts of the top layers, it was possible to produce a charm closely resembling
a human eye, both in shape and color.</p>

<p>Such eyes are still sold today, and many people treasure them in the hope
that they will ward off evil in any form.</p>

<p><i>THE JADE AXE-HEAD.</i>&mdash;Many jewelers still sell little axe-heads carved
out of jade, for wearing around the neck. The axe-head has been considered
a symbol of strength and vigor ever since primitive times, and jade has a
world-wide reputation as a charm against disease and accidents.</p>

<p><i>THE SEAL OF SOLOMON.</i>&mdash;This device is now regarded as a symbol
of the Jewish religion, but it can be traced to several other religions, and,
no doubt, it dates even farther back than the commencement of the Jewish
era. The triangle with the upward point stood for goodness; the triangle
with the downward point for wickedness; while the two intertwined symbolized
the triumph of good over bad. Those who wear the device contend
that it preserves them from all that is ill, and, at the same time, it gives
them a share of the world's blessings.</p>

<div class="figcenter bigfig">
<img src="images/i_010.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 5.&mdash;The Seal of Solomon, one of the oldest lucky charms in existence.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>THE ABRACADABRA.</i>&mdash;This charm dates from the second century,
and was a symbol of the Gnostic worship. It often took the form of a little
piece of parchment, folded into the shape of a cross, but it can, also, be seen
as a tablet, made of stone or metal, shaped like an inverted triangle. On
the charm, of whatever shape, was inscribed the following:</p>

<p class="abracadabra">
A B R A C A D A B R A<br />
B R A C A D A B R<br />
R A C A D A B<br />
A C A D A<br />
C A D<br />
A
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen that the word "Abracadabra" can be read along the upper
line and also down and up the two sides. This word is said to conceal the
name of God and the charm has the powers of warding off dangers and
sickness.</p>

<p><i>THE FOUR-LEAF CLOVER OR SHAMROCK.</i>&mdash;Everyone knows that
a four-leaf clover or shamrock is supposed to be a bringer of luck and good
fortune. As these are not readily found and, moreover, they soon perish, the
opportunity has been seized by jewelers to produce artificial ones in various
precious and semi-precious metals. To wear either is supposed to avoid
misfortune. It may be mentioned that the four-leaf Shamrock as a charm
has proved immensely popular by those who are interested in the Irish sweepstakes.</p>

<p><i>BLACK CATS.</i>&mdash;Of course, it is lucky for a black cat to walk into your
house, but failing an actual cat, a counterfeit one serves the same purpose.
Thus, people who pin their faith to black cats often make stuffed ones, or
draw pictures of them, and look to the creature of their own handiwork to
serve the role of mascot.</p>

<p><i>YOUR OWN TALISMAN.</i>&mdash;So far, the talismans that have received universal
acceptance have alone been mentioned, but the tendency today is for
enthusiasts to originate a mascot of their very own. It may take any or
every form, according to the whim or fancy of the individual. Maybe you will
prefer to find your own mascot or talisman in this direction. If you have no
preferences, why not constitute a device which embraces your lucky number,
your lucky flower, your lucky color, and so on? It is a suggestion bristling
with opportunities.</p>

<p>Just to show that people are tending towards the idea of choosing a talisman
of their very own, we will conclude with a story that was recently
published.</p>

<p>"There is a precious stone to which the board of directors of a firm of
diamond dealers annually pass a vote of thanks. The stone is a sapphire
and it has been named Shani, meaning 'bringer of luck.'</p>

<p>"Shani was bought by the firm about seventy years ago, and it only
leaves the safe on New Year's Day. A special meeting, attended by every
member of the firm, is then held in the board room. Shani is placed in
the middle of the table and, with hands clasped in prayer, the members
offer thanks for the good luck the sapphire has brought the firm during the
preceding year.</p>

<p>"One of the directors said, 'My grandfather once received a tempting offer
for Shani and yielded, but a few hours after the sapphire had been sent
away he was taken violently ill with fever. The sapphire was brought back
from a distant part of India, and my grandfather became well at once.'"</p>

<p>Should not we all have a Shani?</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>HINTS ON FORTUNETELLING</h2>
</div>


<p>Hundreds of dollars are paid each week to professional fortunetellers
by people in all walks of life, in order that they may gain a peep into
the future. These people belong to every class of society; they are of all ages
and they consult the mediums on almost every matter connected with human
existence. There is the industrial magnate, the society girl, and the hard-working
shop assistant, all anxious to peer into the coming months.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the teller of fortunes and the writer of horoscopes is doing
an excellent business. The dollars and the cents are pouring in at a remarkable
rate, and those who read the future, as a profession, are having the
time of their lives.</p>

<p>This state of things is one calculated to make you stop and think for a
moment. Why should not you learn the rudiments of fortunetelling yourself?
Why should not you find out how to read the signs of your own
future and the future of your friends? The subject is interesting; it is not
a difficult one and all you need to know is set out in this book.</p>

<p>Your course of study may well begin with the chapter on Palmistry.
Having mastered that, turn to the one on Handwriting, and follow with
"<a href="#Page_46"><i>What do your Bumps Mean?</i></a>" These three sections will give you a very
useful start and then you might continue with "<a href="#Page_49"><i>How Astrology Decides Your
Destiny</i></a>" and "<a href="#Page_40"><i>Your Face is Your Fortune</i></a>."</p>

<p>The five chapters named will enable you to read people with a great
deal of success, and it should not be long before your friends compliment you
on your accuracy. Probably this will spur you to further efforts, and you
will study the passages on lucky numbers, dreams, tea-cup readings, lucky
colors, etc. These will add a polish to your preliminary knowledge.</p>

<p>Very soon you will gain a reputation as a seer and it will add not a little to
your vanity when people come to you and ask you to read their futures.
In doing so, you will be advised to follow a few rules. Never jump to hasty
conclusions. Weigh all the facts and strike a balance. If the hand says
"yes" and the face says "no," the conclusion is that "it may be." When
disappointing things are noted, be charitable and let the applicant off lightly.
In cases where dire illnesses are portended, suppress the facts or state them
in such a way that the applicant has a chance of avoiding the trouble, if he
or she takes suitable measures. But, whatever happens, never make a statement
for which you have not "chapter and verse."</p>

<p>And this brings me to my last point. Hands, faces, heads and other
characteristics give their readings, but none of these readings should be taken
as absolutely final. The power is within us to fight against our failings and
to better our good qualities. We may even allow our best ones to deteriorate.
That is why two people born at the same time and in the same town need
not grow up exactly alike. And it is also why a small percentage of horoscopes
and fortunes are bound to miss the mark.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>PALMISTRY&mdash;WHAT MAY BE LEARNED
FROM HANDS</h2>
</div>


<p>"There are more things in Heaven and Earth...."</p>

<p>People who can see as far as the ends of their noses and then only
through a fog, declare (with a superior sniff) that Palmistry is nothing but
a trap to catch fools; they call it quackery, or declare perhaps that it is
merely a fake or blind guesswork.</p>

<p>Now, while we would be the first to deny that Palmistry is an exact and
infallible science, yet we just as strongly affirm that it is undoubtedly a most
fascinating and interesting recreation; as to its truth, each one must decide
that question for himself.</p>

<p>For the few who have a wish to take up this study seriously, there are
many now who will naturally wish to know just sufficient to be able to
"tell fortunes." Fortunetellers are always popular at some jolly party or
quiet friendly gathering of an evening.</p>

<p>In this book they will find all the simple information required; on the
other hand the student will find a sincere delight in reading and sifting
thoroughly the numerous books that probe the depths of the subject.</p>

<p>Quite apart from any markings which may be upon the hand, a general
indication of the habits and temperament of the individual in question can
readily be gained by a careful examination of the texture or quality of
the skin.</p>

<p>It were as well to note here that the impressions gained must never be
taken by themselves, but only in conjunction with other confirming signs.
Especially is this so when judging the character of a friend or acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>TEXTURE OF SKIN.</i>&mdash;The skin may, of course, be smooth or rough.
To judge this you should turn the hand in question back upwards; now get
the feel of the skin by actual touch; a smooth, fine-textured skin denotes
a refined nature, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>. This is a very strong indication indeed,
insomuch that should there be other tendencies pointing to coarseness of
nature, this texture of the hand would have a refining effect upon the whole.</p>

<p><i>ELASTICITY OF THE HAND.</i>&mdash;This is best tested by actual grip (as
in shaking hands). All hands naturally present some feeling of elasticity;
this is a matter of comparison, but it is very easy to tell the quick, virile
grip of an elastic hand to the dead fish feeling which a flabby hand gives
us when we grasp it.</p>

<p><i>A FLEXIBLE HAND</i> denotes an active and energetic person, one who
will be readily adaptable to new conditions. He will always rise to the
occasion, and manfully withstands the buffets of ill-fortune. This type is
always trustworthy and a good friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bigfig">
<img src="images/i_014.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 6.&mdash;Beware of these Hands.&mdash;A shows a weak, flattened thumb; B a curved little
finger and C a coarse, short thumb. Each has other defects as well.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A FLABBY HAND</i>&mdash;one that does not respond to your grip or responds
but sluggishly&mdash;is the hand of an idle man, untrustworthy and inconsistent,
a man of weak and negative character; but be sure to search well for other
confirming signs of this weakness.</p>


<h3>THE SHAPE OF THE HAND</h3>

<p>A fairly accurate guide to character is certainly contained in the shape
of the hand. Hands may be roughly divided into two classes&mdash;broad and
long. A person having a <em>long hand</em> you may judge to have great capacity
for mental effort and matters of detail.</p>

<p>The broad-handed person you may expect to be a strong man physically;
his culture will be bodily rather than mental. He could with advantage
improve his culture by reading, and by enjoying the best music.</p>


<h3>THE SHAPE OF THE FINGERS</h3>

<p>When an individual is found with <em>square</em> finger-tips, he should make
a good marriage partner; he will be practical&mdash;a man of method and
reason. He is punctual, but should cultivate imagination.</p>

<p><i>POINTED FINGER</i> tips will be found on the hand of the musician,
the painter, and, in fact, anyone who is of artistic temperament.</p>

<p>Persons with these fingers should curb their imagination with reason,
and cultivate the power of doing things, not only dreaming them, though
dreaming is well enough in its way.</p>

<p><i>TAPERING</i> fingers indicate people of extremes. "Ice and fire" are these
people&mdash;impulsive and generous to a fault. They should guard against
undue and morbid sensitiveness, and should cultivate a sane philosophical
outlook upon life. They are capable of the highest, but are frequently their
own worst enemies.</p>

<p><i>SPATULATE FINGERS.</i>&mdash;These are the sportsmen of the world. They
are not worried much by the opinions of others, while they love a busy,
healthy life; a sound mind in a sound body.</p>


<h3>GENERAL SHAPE AND FORMATION OF THE HAND</h3>

<p>If the hands are knotted with the joints swollen, powers of analysis,
calculation and reflection are shown; philosophers have this type of hand.</p>

<p><i>SMOOTH</i> fingers and hands indicate the artistic temperament. These
people are frequently inspired, and have curious intuitions concerning coming
events. Musicians, spiritualists, and martyrs are of this type, together
with many folk who are square pegs in round holes; maybe doing work
which is uncongenial to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><i>THE THUMB</i> has also in it certain very marked indications of character.
The three bones (or Phalanges) in the thumb each have their interpretation.
Beginning at the top these should be judged by length as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">
1. Will. (The pushing type of man.)<br />
2. Reasoning power. (The thinker or philosopher.)<br />
3. Love.
</p>

<p>Thus a long first or top phalange indicates great will power; or if it is
not a certain indication, it points to a definite likelihood of the will being
strong.</p>


<h3>THE MOUNTS</h3>

<p>Take your subject's hand and examine it closely; a strong magnifying
glass should form part of the equipment of every wise palmist. It will be
seen that there are certain portions of the hands which are raised above
the surface. These are known as "mounts." As will be noticed in the
accompanying picture, we call these mounts by astrological names, a method
adopted from the very earliest times. They are eight in number, named:
Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Apollo, Luna and Mars (of which there
are two).</p>

<p>Let us look at our picture on page 21. At the base of the first finger
you will see Mount Jupiter, then taking the base of each finger in turn,
will be found Mounts Saturn, Apollo, and Mercury. Mount Luna will be
found at the base of the hand, below the little finger, near the wrist, Mount
Mars just above it, Mount Venus stands below Jupiter and at the root of
the thumb, with the second Mars above it.</p>

<p>All individuals have not these mounts developed to the same extent,
and in these variations strong indications of character are to be found.</p>

<p>We will now have a little discussion upon the subject of Mounts, taking
each individually, and in turn.</p>

<p>Usually one of these mounts in your subject's hands will be found to stand
out clearly from the remainder. This will give you a good idea of the
general type of person whose hand you are judging.</p>

<p>These are the general indications to be found.</p>

<p><i>THE SATURNIAN.</i>&mdash;If the Mount of Saturn be over-developed, you have
the cold, sceptical type of man. He lacks the milk of human kindness, and
is probably a pessimist. A moderate development, on the other hand, is good;
this man should be prudent, not miserly; optimistic yet not fatuously so,
a well-balanced man.</p>

<p>We well know that the excess or over-development of one particular
quality (however excellent this quality may be) is evil. Thus a super-artistic
temperament gives the neurotic; while the over-prudent man becomes
the grasping miser.</p>

<p><i>THE JUPITERIAN.</i>&mdash;Jupiterians, or folk with an excessively strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
mount of this name, are the strong men of the world. In excess they are
ambitious to a fault, masterful, overbearing and bullying. With a moderate
development we have exceedingly good qualities indicated. Power of leadership,
rightful ambition, initiative, and great abilities for hard work.</p>

<p><i>THE APOLLONIAN.</i>&mdash;Taking the men and women of Apollo we have
the essential optimists, the Micawbers and Mark Tapleys of life. Allied to
their cheery natures is a love of the artistic and the really beautiful. The
sculptors, painters, and musicians who make life so pleasant, are very frequently
Apollonians. The best advice to give an Apollonian is "moderation
in all things." He or she must be very careful in the choice of a marriage
partner; this last is very important indeed.</p>

<p><i>THE MERCURIAN.</i>&mdash;In excess we have craft, guile, and fondness for
falsehoods. In moderation we find the good business man, shrewd, cautious,
possessor of a capacity for doing the lion's share of the work, and a fine
eye for the main chance. Let him cultivate his opposites. Unselfishness,
kindness and generosity will make a Mercurian a most charming person.
Their lack will leave a clever, scheming scoundrel.</p>

<p><i>THE MARTIAN.</i>&mdash;When we find Mars in the ascendant (i. e., the
mounts excessively developed) we find aggression and even bullying. In
moderation we have a fighter in the best sense of the word; a man who
will withstand the blows of fate and fight his way through life, resisting
evil. He is never mean, and you will find him a sincere and trustworthy
friend.</p>

<p><i>THE VENUSIAN.</i>&mdash;When this mount is predominant in excess we find
a person of unbalanced mind; he will be careless and will make a dangerous
marriage partner. Developed to a moderate degree we find generosity,
a power to feel for others, with a pleasing personality. The folk of Venus
love beauty, and love their life; they are strongly attracted to those of the
opposite sex, and are likely to fall in love without counting the cost. These
people should cultivate a habit of thinking before they act, and should not
allow generosity to degenerate into extravagance.</p>

<p><i>THE LUNARIAN.</i>&mdash;Lastly let us take the Mount of the Moon. In excess
we again find the neurotic or unduly nervous person. In moderation the
Lunarian will be a person of imagination, sympathy, and one who loves to
look on all that is most beautiful in life. He should be successful as a
musician, playwright, or novelist, and has a ready capacity for learning
foreign languages.</p>

<p>Let me give one piece of final advice to those who truly judge character
by the mounts, or indeed by any signs on the hand. Never judge by one
sign or you will be led into stupid mistakes. Always take the hand as a
whole, for frequently some point in the formation striking you as bad may
be strongly counterbalanced by other good signs.</p>

<p>This is exceedingly important, and rightly applied will save you many
foolish pitfalls in your early fortunetelling days!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE FINGERS</h3>

<p>Each of the mounts at the base of the fingers gives its name to the finger
above it, i. e., the first finger is called Jupiter, the little finger is Mercury,
and so on.</p>

<p>When judging character by the mounts, the fingers which share their name
must also always be noted as to their development. Let us first take Jupiter.</p>

<p>If that finger is well developed (i. e., long in comparison to the remainder)
this will accentuate the Jupiterian qualities seen in the well-developed
mounts. This may be applied throughout the mounts. The
important thing to remember is that mount and corresponding finger should
be read together. This is essential.</p>

<p>To conclude this section let us take the phalanges (or joints of the finger)
with their interpretations.</p>

<p>Counting from the top joint nearest to the nail, the meaning given by
palmists to the three phalanges of each finger are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<em>Length of phalanx</em>, or distance between the respective joints, is the <em>deciding
factor</em>.) For simplicity, we have made a small table.</p>

<h3>THE LINES OF YOUR DESTINY</h3>

<p>We now come to the most fascinating side of Palmistry&mdash;the actual study
of the network of lines upon the hand, and their relation to the mounts
and to each other.</p>

<p>This is where your magnifying glass will be of enormous value. There
are very many small signs, seemingly of little matter, but in reality of very
great importance, such as stars, crosses, squares, and triangles, little marks
with frequently great meanings.</p>

<p>One word of warning must be given before we go farther. If you see
evil in a palm never on any account tell of it. But if you see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
some misfortune approaching which a little foresight might avoid, by all
means warn your subject. Should you by any chance see, or think you see,
anything calculated to alarm another, keep it to yourself. Always remember
that human intelligence is frail and finite but life is infinite. Palmistry
shares in this frailty; it is interesting and intensely fascinating, but far from
infallible. It is not an exact science in the sense of mathematics, where two
plus two equals four, no more and no less.</p>

<p>Let us take these lines in turn and discuss the meaning of each.</p>


<h3>THE LIFE LINE</h3>

<p>When the Life line rises high in the hand, great ambition is shown. If
you see a Life line circling well into the palm (thus forming a large Mount
of Venus) emotional characteristics such as love and generosity are shown.
If, on the contrary, the line forms a small Mount of Venus, coldness will
be predominant.</p>

<p>If the Life line commences very feebly and gradually strengthens, this
is a good sign. It indicates a weak childhood but a robust maturity.</p>


<h3>THE HEAD LINE</h3>

<p>The Head line works in conjunction with the line of Health (see illustration),
thus:&mdash;If the Head line is broken some ill health may be indicated
which has made or will make its effect felt upon the brain and thinking
powers. But only if all other lines should support this.</p>

<p>An independent nature is shown when the Head line branches off from
the Life line early in its course, and vice versa.</p>

<p>If the Head line should curve towards Saturn, there is shown a material
outlook upon life; this is the financier's Head line. Curving towards Apollo
an artistic nature is shown, while should this line originate near Mount
Jupiter it is a sure sign of capacity for leadership, and many go-ahead qualities
that make for success. If the Head line is firm, a definite, purposeful nature
is probable, while a weak, wavy Head line indicates a weak, wavering outlook
upon life.</p>

<p>With the Head line joining the Heart line, emotional qualities are to the
fore; this individual is impulsive and should put the curb of reason upon
himself.</p>

<p>Should the Head line have branches which run towards Mount Mercury,
Luna and Mars, it is an excellent sign, showing good balance, ready wit,
and quick adaptability.</p>


<h3>THE HEART LINE</h3>

<p>When this originates on or near the mount called Saturn, there is a
leaning towards a sensual, pleasure-loving nature.</p>

<p>Rising from between Saturn and its neighbor Jupiter, we have a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
deliberate, practical man. His love, while very sincere, is governed by
reason; he is intensely practical, and rather lacking in imagination, which it
were well worth his while to cultivate. His head will always rule his Heart,
especially is this indicated should the Heart line bend towards that of the
Head.</p>

<p>Should the Heart line cross the palm entirely, the owner is the exact
opposite of the individual just mentioned. This person's heart will rule
his head; he is sentimental even to a fault, and should practice business-like
qualities, and not dream overmuch. Love in a cottage is all very well&mdash;but
how when the roof leaks?</p>

<p>A short Heart line is a warning for care in marriage; without this care
a couple may well come to shipwreck on the rocks of married life. Forewarned
is forearmed!</p>


<h3>THE LINE OF FORTUNE</h3>

<p>This is a line running (as its name suggests) towards the Mount of
Apollo. It is a valuable and somewhat rarely-found line. This is the line
of genius; effort will scarcely be needed by its owner; he will seem to fly
towards success on the wings of destiny.</p>

<p>This is the ideal, but it must be borne in mind that there are other lines
which must be studied in conjunction with it.</p>

<p>On the other hand its absence does by no means prohibit or even endanger
success; it merely indicates that individual effort will be required, and what
is life without something to strive for?</p>


<h3>THE HEALTH LINE</h3>

<p>A good strong Health line is very desirable; should this line be broken,
however, there is no need for alarm, it is merely indicated that a certain
amount of care is necessary in one's personal habits of life.</p>


<h3>THE LINE OF FATE</h3>

<p>This line runs across the middle of the palm, from the Mount of Saturn
to the Bracelets, but its full course need not be traced on any particular
hand. When of full length and a middle position is revealed, the fate of the
individual may be reckoned as particularly lucky. Such a person has strong
determination, can make quick decisions and can be powerful without
being a tyrant. He has the power of drawing people to him, in a friendly
way, and is, thus, always liked.</p>

<p>Should the line run from the Bracelets and stop at the Head line, this is
a sign that the possessor will have many troubles and obstacles to overcome.
Whether he will surmount them depends on the strength of the Head line.
In cases where the Fate line continues up one of the fingers, the owner must
take care that success does not turn his head and ruin the future. A Fate
line that wriggles its way across the palm indicates a life of ups and downs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a><br /><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>and, should the line be broken in places, it is a sign that happiness
will vary from time to time. Generally speaking, if small lines run upwards
out of the Fate line, the signs are good, but the reverse is the case if they
run downwards.</p>


<h3>THE LINE OF MARRIAGE</h3>

<p>This line is a short, comparatively inconspicuous one, found at the edge
of the palm, below the little finger. It runs inwards but not very far
towards the center of the palm. How to recognize its significance is explained
under the heading, "An ABC of Hands."</p>

<p>Now let us put our house in order, refresh our minds, and summarize the
broad principles upon which any study of Palmistry must rest.</p>

<p>First we have the mounts. It is in the varying relation of the lines to
these mounts and to their adjacent fingers that our deductions are founded.
One mount lies at the base of each finger, Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo and Mercury
respectively. Secondly, we have the four fingers with their astrological
names, each finger bearing the name of the mount at its base.</p>

<p>Here is a good, sound rule to remember when reading the hands of your
friends. First find your type&mdash;i.e., Jupiterian, Apollonian, etc. This is
accomplished by noting the main characteristics of the hand which you are
examining. Suppose that the Mount of Apollo is fully developed and well
raised, and that the finger of Apollo is inclined to be long, there you have
practically a pure Apollonian type, i.e., Apollo in excess. If the Mount
of Apollo is developed but also the finger of Saturn is long, this forms an
admirable mixture. This subject will feel the benefit of the steadying influence
of Saturn at work on his light-hearted Apollonian nature.</p>

<p>Pure types are rare&mdash;and fortunately so&mdash;for in a pure type, no matter
which, you are frequently liable to find a rather poorly-balanced outlook on
life. The cold need heat, and the brilliant require solid perseverance and a
capacity for hard work to win lasting success.</p>

</div>


<h3>WHICH HAND SHOULD BE READ?</h3>

<p>The answer to this question is a very decided both! As a general rule
the left hand will show the inherent characteristics of the individual; the
right hand shows the same characteristics modified by our surroundings or by
the individual's personal efforts. The former is possibility&mdash;the latter actuality;
in short, it is what we actually make our life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The safest rule about reading right and left hands is this:&mdash;Read both
hands separately and carefully, then read them in their relation one to
the other.</p>

<p>There is no blind fatalism in the sayings and doings of a true student of
Palmistry. What he does or should do is to point out the likelihoods and
warn against inherent weakness. In so much he is like a guide helping us
to pick our way through the tortuous maze of life.</p>

<p>It may strike some of our readers that we have spoken more of the indications
of character to be found in the hand rather than of the indications
of "Fortune." A few moments' thought will show a very sound reason
for this.</p>

<p>It is certainly our characters which shape our destinies; should you find
a hand with all the indications of strong character, while also possessing a
strong will and well-cut Life line, you would be sure in prophesying a happy
life for its owner; or as sure as we poor humans ever can hope to be!</p>

<p>If you find a hand with the indications of weak will and character, yet
with the Health and Life lines strong and well defined, you may well advise
the owner of the hand that effort, effort and effort again, is required if he
or she would win through!</p>

<p>Remember that tact is more precious than fine gold! A tactful and timely
warning may prove of the greatest value, while without tact you will surround
yourself with an army of acquaintances whose feelings you have
hurt by your thoughtless and unintentionally cruel remarks!</p>

<p>There is no infallibility about this matter, but with the facts given in this
book there are vast possibilities for really pleasurable and interesting recreation.
If the study be taken up seriously, and used with discretion, there
are almost unbelievable opportunities for good.</p>

<p>This is what a man once said to me&mdash;and he was a man who thought
deeply, and probed matters to their depths:</p>

<p>"A wise palmist is as precious as a careful signalman upon life's crowded
railroad, and a wise palmist is a tactful palmist."</p>


<h3>AN A B C OF HANDS</h3>

<p>In order to be able to follow the explanations given for each type of
hand, the list set out below will prove useful.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) The 1st phalange is the section of the finger carrying the nail.<br />

(2) The 2nd phalange is the section of the finger between the 1st and
2nd joints.<br />

(3) The 3rd phalange is the section of the finger between the 2nd and
3rd joints.<br />

(4) The positions of the Mounts of Mercury, Apollo, Saturn, Jupiter,
Luna and Venus are shown in <a href="#handmap">Fig. 7</a>. Of the Mounts of Mars, there are
two positions. One is situated between the Mount of Jupiter and the thumb,
while the other comes between the Mounts of Mercury and Luna.<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>

(5) The Girdle of Venus, which is rarely found, is a curved line running
between Mercury and either Jupiter or Saturn.<br />

(6) The Bracelets are the lines running across the wrist, close to where
it joins the palm.</p>

<p><i>CONCEITED PERSON.</i>&mdash;Very plump Mounts of Saturn, Apollo and
Mercury.</p>

<p><i>CONSCIENTIOUS PERSON.</i>&mdash;A broad, thin hand, a very distinct Mount
of Jupiter, and the first phalange of the thumb nicely curved.</p>

<p><i>CONVINCING SPEAKER.</i>&mdash;The fourth finger is almost as long as the
third, usually because the first phalange is long. This finger is pointed.</p>

<p><i>CORDIALITY.</i>&mdash;The Heart line extends almost across the palm; it is
straight, except at one end, which branches into a fork.</p>

<p><i>COWARDLY.</i>&mdash;When the hand is opened out flat, the fourth phalanges of
all the fingers dip or curve downwards. None of the mounts are distinct.</p>

<p><i>CRUEL PERSON.</i>&mdash;The Heart line is almost or quite non-existing. The

palm. It is clear throughout, while the four mounts below the four fingers
are very distinct.</p>

<p><i>ENVIOUS PERSON.</i>&mdash;On the first finger there are several clear lines;
they are found mostly on the third phalange, but some exist on the second.
None on the first.</p>

<p><i>EXTRAVAGANT PERSON.</i>&mdash;The tips of all the fingers bend back and
the Head line is weak.</p>

<p><i>FAITHLESS PERSON.</i>&mdash;The two Mounts of Mars and that of Mercury
stand out more clearly than the others.</p>

<p><i>FAME, PERSON DESTINED FOR.</i>&mdash;The Fate line is more distinct

<p><i>FAR-SEEING PERSON.</i>&mdash;The palm is depressed in the middle, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
thumb is well developed, strong in outline, and all the phalanges of the
fingers are about as long as they are wide.</p>

<p><i>FAULT-FINDING PERSON.</i>&mdash;A long, narrow hand, with an ill-defined
Heart line.</p>

<p><i>FLIRT.</i>&mdash;The Head line consists of a line joining up several links, forming
a species of chain.</p>

<p><i>FORCEFUL PERSON.</i>&mdash;A cross on the Mount of Apollo and small lines
crossing.</p>

<p><i>FORTUNATE PERSON.</i>&mdash;The Heart and Head lines almost touch below
the Mount of Jupiter. A cross is often found between them just at
this point. The third finger shows a long line running the length of two
phalanges.</p>

<p><i>GOOD CHARACTER.</i>&mdash;The Mounts of Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury are
much in evidence, while the tips of the fingers are nicely rounded.</p>

<p><i>GREEDY PERSON.</i>&mdash;When the hand is spread out the fingers bend
inwards, because of the excessive width of the palm. The Head line runs
across the palm almost in a straight line.</p>

<p><i>HAPPY PERSON.</i>&mdash;On the third finger there is a deep line running the
length of the third phalange. Also, the bracelets appear as a single deep
furrow.</p>

<p><i>HARD WORKER.</i>&mdash;The fourth finger has the second phalange a trifle
long, while the two Mounts or Mars are well developed.</p>

<p><i>JUST PERSON.</i>&mdash;Square-tipped fingers and square nails, while the space
formed between the Heart and Head lines is unusually wide.</p>

<p><i>KIND PERSON.</i>&mdash;A star figures on the thumb, while the Mounts of
Apollo and Mercury are much in evidence. The Heart line is not short.</p>

<p><i>LIKING FOR OPPOSITE SEX.</i>&mdash;A star is seen on the Mount of Mercury
or a star may appear between the Heart and Head lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><i>LONG LIFE.</i>&mdash;The Heart line curves entirely round the thumb, being
plainly evident all the way, while the bracelets consist of three clear lines.</p>

<p><i>LUCKY PERSON.</i>&mdash;See diagram of a very lucky hand.</p>

<p><i>MARRIAGE.</i>&mdash;The Marriage line is a comparatively short line, found
above the Heart line and starting from the edge of the palm, under the little
finger.</p>

<div class="indent">
    <p>If straight and well defined, it is a sign of a happy married life. (See
    Fig. A, p. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>.)</p>

    <p>If curved down, there are troubles to overcome.</p>

    <p>If the line runs down to the Heart line, money difficulties will arise in
    married life. (See <a href="#Page_23">Fig. B.</a>)</p>

    <p>If the line ends in a fork, there are fears of quarrels and, perhaps,
    separations. (See <a href="#Page_23">Fig. C.</a>)</p>

    <p>If the line runs up and touches the Fate line, marriage will bring many
    successes.</p>

    <p>If there is practically no length to the actual marriage line, but a fork
    appears almost at the commencement, it is a clear proof that troubles will
    arise and prevent the owner from marrying when he or she desires it. There
    will be delays, postponements and other difficulties, but they will be overcome
    in the end. (See <a href="#Page_23">Fig. D.</a>)</p>

    <p>If there is an island where the line should commence, this may be taken
    as a sign that the possessor is not a suitable person for marriage. But, if
    the line is a good one, after the island is past, there are hopes that he or
    she will mend. (See <a href="#Page_23">Fig. E.</a>)</p>

    <p>If the marriage line hardly exists or does not appear at all, it is a sign
    of single blessedness through life.</p>

    <p>If the marriage line on the right hand is minutely examined, short hair
    lines may be seen rising upwards from it. The number of these denotes
    the number of children of the marriage. It is usually said that the perpendicular
    lines represent the boys and the slanting lines the girls. As these
    lines are often very indistinct, it may be necessary to dust the hand with
    a dab of face-powder, in order to see them.</p>
</div>

<p><i>NARROW-MINDED PERSON.</i>&mdash;The Head line is short and it wavers
or wriggles its way across the palm.</p>

<p><i>NEAT, ORDERLY PERSON.</i>&mdash;Where each finger is hinged to the palm,
there is a deep crease making a badge on either side of it. The hand
itself is square and vigorous in appearance.</p>

<p><i>NERVOUS PERSON.</i>&mdash;The hand is very much lined, and there is difficulty
in picking out the chief lines. The Mount of Luna is large and much
furrowed.</p>

Jupiter is large; the first phalanges of all the fingers are decidedly long, and
there is a cross in the center of the palm, close to the Head and Heart lines.</p>

<p><i>SECOND-SIGHT, PERSON WITH.</i>&mdash;An unusual line runs from the
Mount of Luna to the Mount of Mercury. It takes a circular course and
much resembles the Life line, reversed. This line commences with an island.</p>

<p><i>SLEEPY PERSON.</i>&mdash;A deeply-grooved short Head line.</p>

<p><i>SUCCESSFUL PERSON.</i>&mdash;The Life line starts from the Mount of Jupiter
and is double throughout its course. The Heart line commences at almost
the same spot and is forked at both ends.</p>

<p><i>SUPERSTITIOUS PERSON.</i>&mdash;The Mount of Jupiter is particularly well
developed. There are several lines running across it; while the Head line is
shorter than usual.</p>

the skin is smooth and silky, and all the first phalanges are plump and,
perhaps, longitudinally lined.</p>

<p><i>TALKATIVE PERSON.</i>&mdash;The Heart and Head lines are not easily discovered,
and the Mount of Mercury stands up more than the other mounts.</p>

<p><i>THOUGHTFUL PERSON.</i>&mdash;The first finger almost as long as the second;
it is pointed at the tip more than the others. A wide space is formed between
the Heart, Head, Fate and Fortune (or Health) lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><i>TIMID PERSON.</i>&mdash;None of the Mounts appear plainly, while the Head
and Heart lines run very close together.</p>

<p><i>UNTRUTHFUL PERSON.</i>&mdash;The little finger is long, reaching at least to
the base of the nail of the third finger. The Mount of Luna is crossed with
many lines.</p>

<p><i>VAIN PERSON.</i>&mdash;The Mount of Jupiter is fuller than the others and it is
crossed with many lines. The fingers are long and rather pointed.</p>

<p><i>VINDICTIVE PERSON.</i>&mdash;The Head line wriggles along its course. It
has a fork close to the Mount of Luna.</p>

<p><i>WEALTHY PERSON.</i>&mdash;When earned, the Mount of Luna, on both
hands, shows a number of lines which all run in one direction. They do not
cross at all. When inherited, the same, but there is, in addition, a cross
on the Bracelets.</p>

<p><i>WITTY PERSON.</i>&mdash;The Mount of Mercury shows up clearly. In addition,
there is a curved line which runs from the junction of the first and
second fingers to the junction of the third and fourth fingers. The Heart
line is usually good.</p>

<h2>YOUR HANDWRITING REVEALS
YOUR CHARACTER</h2>
</div>


<p>Your handwriting is you; disguise it as you will, it still reveals your character.
As a matter of fact, it is a sheer impossibility for an ordinary person
to alter his or her writing completely. The natural hand and the purposely-changed
hand will bear several resemblances, however hard the individual
may try to make them dissimilar. This is due to the fact that the same
character lies behind both efforts. Not only is your handwriting you, but
the handwriting of your friend is "him or her." This being so, you will
find it a simple matter to arrive at his or her qualities by analyzing a few
lines of the person's handwriting. To become sufficiently expert for this,
you will not need more than half-an-hour's study.</p>

<p><em>FIRST</em> of all we must attend to the direction of the lines of writing, as,
should these be level, a normal and calm state of mind is shown, generally
reliable, and not subject to change.</p>

<p>When the lines slope toward the right, much energy is indicated; when
the lines slope downward, a lack of energy is shown, usually from depression
which may result from ill health.</p>

<p>If the writing slopes upward with excess, it shows recklessness; if downwards,
with a very sloping inclination, it shows mental depression verging
almost on loss of reason.</p>

<p>If the signature slopes upwards, then we may expect to find personal
ambition, but if downwards, some physical weakness. If instead of the
whole line ascending only words here and there will ascend, this indicates
"hope," but if scattered words ascend and descend in the same line, we may
read a lack of tenacity in emotions.</p>

<p><em>SECONDLY.</em>&mdash;The lines forming the letters may appear:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(A) Practically upright; or</p>

<p>(B) Sloping slightly to the right.</p>

<p>(C) Sloping very much to the right as if each letter were falling
over the rest.</p>

<p>(D) Sloping to the left, and lastly,</p>

<p>(E) "Back-hand writing."</p></div>

<p>Between A and B might be called normal.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Shows pluck and self-possession, and, if pointed, mathematics.</p>

<p>B Tenderness, but should the writing be pointed, a quick, acute mind,
with no sympathy with sentiment.</p>

<p>C Shows indolence; if with pointed letters, mental power, but should
the letters be rounded, mental and physical indolence.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<p>D Shows a love of ease, while</p>

<p>E Looks peculiar and indicates self-consciousness, and, as a rule, hidden
sentimentality.</p></div>

<p><em>THIRDLY.</em>&mdash;The writing small and pointed, we get curiosity; if medium
in size, and gradually increasing towards the end of the line, it shows an
outspoken nature; should the writing diminish towards the end of the line
we read tact.</p>

<p>If it is fine and threadlike in appearance, it shows a sensitive mind, diplomacy.</p>

<p>Large writing shows promptness, but if the strokes are very fine, we see
appreciation of other people's work&mdash;a connoisseur.</p>

<p>Small, clear writing shows love of the abstruse, and if the lines are very
delicate, a feeling for the mystic. If the writing is extremely small, it shows
pettiness of nature, fussiness over unimportant details.</p>

<p>Letters of different sizes show unreliability of nature, exaggerating trifles
and ignoring more important things.</p>

<p>Light and fine writing means delicacy of feeling, but if carried to excess
it shows fastidiousness.</p>

<p><em>FOURTHLY.</em>&mdash;The connections of the letters with each other must be
judged. If the connecting stroke is long, it shows some facility in talking
and expression, the power of using words well, <em>not</em> talkativeness.</p>

<p>Letters ingeniously connected show constructiveness, but should they be
separate, we get perception and intuition.</p>

<p>Any eccentricity indicates that the person's career has not been ordinary.
Marked originality, especially of capitals, shows unusual taste. Tremulous
tendency resulting neither from illness nor old age&mdash;Irritability. Highly
restrained, small&mdash;Refractory disposition, difficult to live with. Regular and
well-placed lines, followed by those careless and irregular&mdash;A mind quick
to embark on an enterprise, but lacking perseverance. Back-handed less
susceptible than inclined&mdash;The head ruling the heart.</p>

<p>Generally the body of the letter or specimen gives the present character,
the signature the past.</p>

<p><i>CROTCHETS.</i>&mdash;Egotism, self-satisfaction (a return upon self.)</p>

<p><i>HARPOONS (HOOKS).</i>&mdash;Tenacity, united perhaps with weak will.</p>

<p><i>DASHES.</i>&mdash;Perfectly straight&mdash;Persistence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Undulating.&mdash;Art, levity.</p>

<p>Undulating, beginning or finishing with a crotchet or ungraceful flourish.&mdash;Lack
of taste, slight vulgarity.</p>

<p>Light.&mdash;Writer attaches little idea to things expressed.</p>

<p>Ending Thickly.&mdash;Resolution, desires ideas to carry weight.</p>

<p>Curved Ascendingly.&mdash;Versatility; slight inconsistency; speaks without
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Tremulous.&mdash;Timidity, hesitation.</p>

<p>Placed at end of line or paragraph.&mdash;Lack of self-assertion.</p>

<p>Ending abruptly, thick and hard.&mdash;Distrust, reserve.</p>

<p>Sharply elongated.&mdash;Impulsive nature; prudence taught by experience.</p>

<p>Used instead of "full stops."&mdash;Cultivated caution.</p></div>

<p><i>CAPITAL LETTERS.</i>&mdash;Large and well-formed.&mdash;Pride.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Print-like in shape.&mdash;Dignity.</p>

<p>Thin strokes.&mdash;Boasting.</p>

<p>Large and badly-formed.&mdash;Egomania.</p>

<p>Large upper hall.&mdash;Self-assertion.</p>

<p>Large bases.&mdash;Self-confidence.</p>

<p>The capital letter of Christian names larger than that of surname.&mdash;Love
of home.</p>

<p>The capital letter of surname larger.&mdash;Love of position.</p>

<p>Small capitals.&mdash;Lack of self-assertion.</p>

<p>Capital letters made like small ones.&mdash;Said to show poetic feeling, love of
Nature.</p>

<p>Print-like in form.&mdash;Originality.</p>

<p>Eccentric in any way.&mdash;Pose or whim.</p>

<p>Widely spaced.&mdash;Love of open air.</p>

<p>Curving far below the line, and almost encircling the word.&mdash;Protective
love of animals.</p>

<p>Letters incorrectly used.&mdash;Small detail made over-important.</p>

<p>Tendency to replace by print.&mdash;Sense of form, artistic and poetic.</p></div>

<p><i>SPECIAL LETTERS.</i>&mdash;<em>A.M.N.H.</em>, <em>G.O.</em>, <em>R.U.W.</em>&mdash;Normal width.&mdash;Well-poised
mind.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Too wide.&mdash;Self-contentment, satisfaction.</p>

<p>Nearly touching.&mdash;Timidity, want of knowledge of the world.</p>

<p>First leg slightly raised.&mdash;Aristocratic tastes.</p>

<p>Second leg exaggerated.&mdash;Pose, affectation.</p>

<p>Unconnected, ending with crotchet rentrant.&mdash;Egotistical, selfish.</p>

<p>The letters begun and ended with a small crotchet rentrant.&mdash;Avarice,
meanness.</p>

<p>Letters and words connected.&mdash;Power of assimilating ideas, but lack of
originality; logic.</p>

<p>Letters disconnected even with their parts.&mdash;Creative power, want of logic.</p>

<p>Equally connected or disconnected.&mdash;Balanced intuition and deduction.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Last letter increasing in size.&mdash;Lack of power of concealment. Decreasing.&mdash;Finesse.</p></div>

<p>Handwriting does not invariably show sex, as the qualities indicated are
common to both men and women.</p>

<p>The writing develops as the soul develops, and imitation comes before
originality.</p>

<h2>YOUR FACE IS YOUR FORTUNE</h2>
</div>


<p>Everybody sums up the faces of his friends and of the people he meets.
It is a habit we all have. But most of us are apt to classify these faces into
groups according to whether the possessors are good-looking, ordinary or
supremely ugly. We say to ourselves, "Isn't So-and-so charming," or alternatively,
"How positively plain is So-and-so."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the degree of beauty expressed in an individual's face
ought to count for very little. What ought to count is the character which
his or her features reveal. Let it be said quite definitely that faces indicate
character more accurately than any other physical property of an individual.
A person can change his voice and he can check his actions, but he cannot
alter his features for more than a second at a time, and then only superficially.</p>

<p>Thus it comes about that faces are definite indications of character, and
these indications are fairly easy to read, once the rules are learned. Of
course, all such things as accidental blemishes, such as scars and broken
noses, must be ignored at the outset.</p>

<p>First, let us take the general shape of the face.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_040.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 12.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>THE SHAPE OF THE FACE.</i>&mdash;There can be thousands of different
shapes, but the normal is shown by Fig. 1, where the width across
the forehead is more than across the chin. The forehead, the nose and the
rest of the face should be about equal in length.</p>

<p>Add to the width across the forehead and you have a brainy person, a
clear thinker, a person whose opinions are worth considering. Of course,
an excess of width in this place suggests some mental instability.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 shows an entirely different type. It may belong to a jolly person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
who is excellent company; but do not go to him for sound advice. There
is not enough length of forehead, nor width of forehead, to house a superabundance
of brains.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 introduces us to a ponderous type, slow-thinking, fond of food, and
with animal instincts lurking in the background of his make-up.</p>

<p>Fig. 4 reveals a long face, narrow for its width. This belongs to a person
who is limited in vision, and who can be very awkward at times. Such an
individual will find it very hard to agree with others, especially in business
matters. He may be deep and more often than not, he is a rather sad
companion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_041.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 13.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>THE NOSE.</i>&mdash;Fig. 1 shows the normal nose, betokening an average
character.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 is too rounded at the tip. Force of character is lacking.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 reveals a drooping line between the tip of the nose and the upper
lip. This stands for a character that loves amusements and is apt to neglect
the real things of life.</p>

<p>Fig. 4 gives a pronounced, fleshy curl where the nose joins the face. This
is a sign that the possessor is a clear thinker, a leader of others, an intelligent
person.</p>

<p>Fig. 5 shows a thin, pointed nose. The possessor is, probably, of a refined
nature, but he or she is apt to be lacking in sympathy, even cruel.</p>

<p>Fig. 6 depicts a curved ridge. This is the nose of a person who lacks a
refined nature. He may be jolly and humorous, but certainly not actuated
by the highest ideals. Many noses of this shape are the result of an accident,
which, of course, does not count.</p>

<p>A long nose indicates cautiousness, watchfulness, and often timidity.</p>

<p>A prominent nose that stands well out from the face shows a desire to
observe and examine things, without the interference of others.</p>

<p>A fleshy tip to the nose displays a kindly nature, and a love of ease.</p>

<p>A short, small nose tells of conceit and a lack of sympathy for others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>A turned-up nose means that the possessor is a busybody, one who cannot
keep a secret, but may be kind and generous.</p>

<p><i>THE EYES.</i>&mdash;Large eyes denote love of talking and the ability to learn
languages.</p>

<p>Small eyes denote secrecy and close-mindedness.</p>

<p>Full, dark eyes denote love of the opposite sex.</p>

<p>Truthful eyes are set straight in the head.</p>

<p>Untruthful eyes slope towards the nose.</p>

<p>Eyes that slope downwards from the nose are cruel and deceitful.</p>

<p>Eyes set widely apart denote breadth of mind.</p>

<p>Eyes set close together denote narrow-mindedness.</p>

<p><i>THE CHEEKS.</i>&mdash;Full, rounded cheeks denote sociability and a love of
friends.</p>

<p>Thin cheeks denote those who prefer their own company.</p>

<p>Fullness in lower part of cheek denotes love of eating and drinking.</p>

<p>A moderate fullness denotes hospitality.</p>

<p>High cheekbones show that the possessor is very methodical. He or she
is likely to interfere in other people's business.</p>

<p><i>THE FOREHEAD.</i>&mdash;Prominent brows denote a practical disposition.</p>

<p>Fullness in center of forehead denotes a good memory for dates and events.</p>

<p>A broad forehead denotes a humorous disposition.</p>

<p>A rounded forehead denotes musical ability; this is usually accompanied
by curved eyebrows and wavy hair.</p>

<p><i>THE MOUTH AND LIPS.</i>&mdash;When upper lip is deeply grooved down
the center, it denotes modesty and refinement.</p>

<p>A plain upper lip, boldness and forwardness.</p>

<p>A long upper lip denotes self-esteem and self-control.</p>

<p>Redness and fullness in center of lip, love and passion for opposite sex.</p>

<p>Fullness at either side shows love of children and animals.</p>

<p>A mouth that displays the teeth when smiling denotes love of approbation
and attention.</p>

<p>A full, red, well-developed lower lip denotes a kindly, sympathetic disposition.</p>

<p>Thin lips denote a hard, selfish, and unsympathetic nature. The same
with straight lips.</p>

<p><i>THE CHIN.</i>&mdash;A receding chin, as shown in Fig. 1, p. <a href="#Page_43">43</a>, denotes a lack
of firmness. It belongs to a person who has insufficient will of his own.</p>

<p>A chin shaped as Fig. 2 or 3, or midway between these, provides a very
acceptable character. There is determination and grit, without an excess of
these qualities. Fig. 2 may be taken as the normal type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Broad, bony structures of the chin denotes conscientiousness and straightforwardness.</p>

<p>Length and projection of chin denotes firmness, stability, and perseverance.</p>

<p>An extremely long and projecting chin denotes stubbornness and obstinacy.
(Fig. 4.)</p>

<p>A full ridge of fat under the chin denotes economy.</p>

<p><i>WRINKLES.</i>&mdash;A wrinkle commencing in the lower cheek and extending
right under the chin, from side to side, is caused from constant talking.</p>

<p>A wrinkle running from the side of the nose, downwards upon the lower
cheek, to the outer corners of the mouth, is a sign of love of approbation.</p>

<p>Whenever in laughter three parallel circular lines are formed in the cheeks
there is a fund of folly in the character.</p>

<p>Wrinkles lying horizontally across the root of the nose denote ability to
command.</p>

<p>Several perpendicular wrinkles between the eyebrows denote a plodding,
persevering disposition.</p>

<p><i>DIMPLES.</i>&mdash;A round dimple in the chin denotes love of the beautiful in
the opposite sex.</p>

<p>Dimples at the outer corners of the mouth are another sign of mirthfulness.</p>

<p>Dimples in the center of cheeks are another sign of approbation.</p>

<p>When a little cleft is seen at the tip of the nose it denotes the natural
critic.</p>

<p>Close attention should always be given to texture and quality of the hair,
eyes, and skin; this is most important, as the coarseness or refinement of
character is shown very plainly to those who take the trouble to notice these
things.</p>

<p>Color of hair, eyes, and skin is also very important; the depth of the feelings
and passions is shown here; poorly colored people are much less passionate
than their deeper colored fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>Thus from dark individuals of coarse quality we expect coarse passions,
and from dark fine-quality individuals deep, refined emotions.</p>

<p><i>THE EYEBROWS.</i>&mdash;Fig. 2 is intended for the eyebrows of a normal
individual. Such a person goes about his duties in an ordinary, intelligent
manner and does his best to make the world a little better place for having
him in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<div class="indent">
    <p>In Fig. 1, the eyebrows have insufficient shape. They belong to an
    individual of extremes; he or she is either too determined or devoid of
    kindness.</p>

    <p>In Fig. 3, the eyebrows are too curved, forming a full semi-circle. This is
    a sign of shallowness; they belong to a person who is not going to put himself
    out for somebody else.</p>

    <p>In Fig. 4, the eyebrows are higher at the outer than at the inner ends.
    Such are difficult to diagnose. They may belong to a very jolly, funny person;
    but they may also belong to someone absolutely untrustworthy, a foxy
    individual, in fact. They should be read in company with other facial signs.</p>

    <p>In Fig. 5, the eyebrows meet on the nose. Hesitate before trusting a
    person so provided. He may be perfectly reliable, but make sure first.</p>

    <p>Nos. 1 to 5 show eyebrows of fine or medium thickness, but Figs. 6 and
    7 are coarser and heavier. Those that are neither too fine or too thick are
    best, since they are more likely to belong to a well-balanced person. Fine
    pencil streaks show a finniky, perhaps unkind nature. Heavy, bushy eyebrows
    point to an austere, querulous nature.</p>

    <p>In Fig. 7, the upstanding hairs suggest a nature that may derive pleasure
    from posing.</p>
</div>

<p><i>A FINAL HINT.</i>&mdash;In checking the "points" of a face, it is often found
that one feature may contradict another. This does not prove that the explanations
given above are incorrect. It goes to show that the character of
the individual is not definitely set in one direction. He may vary at times or
he may have the aptitude for fighting against one characteristic in favor
of another. The only sound plan is to assess the character by striking a
balance of all the "points" at issue.</p>

    <h3>HAVE YOU A MOLE?</h3>

    <p>Many people do not like these little marks, but let them be comforted,
    for in olden times, according to the wise men of the day,
    great reliance was placed on them. Just what a mole means depends
    on where it is to be found. The following may describe a
    mole of your own:&mdash;</p>

    <p>RIGHT EYE (above).&mdash;Wealth and a happy marriage.</p>

<h2>WHAT DO YOUR BUMPS MEAN?</h2>
</div>


<p>Just feel the shape of your own head, and then ask a friend to let you do
the same thing to him or her. Most likely you will be very surprised at the
difference between the two. You may have bumps in certain places while
your friend has them in totally different parts.</p>

<p>The science of phrenology, which is the reading of bumps, has discovered
that bumps in certain places point to certain characteristics; if you have them,
you must have the characteristics, and, if you have not them, you cannot have
those qualities. In fact, the reading of character through the medium of
bumps is a very definite science, and it is a science that can be easily learned
and applied by almost anyone. Of course, there is much to learn, but there
is no need to know a great deal if you merely want to assess a person's
character in general terms.</p>

<p>A chart is supplied on p. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>, and on it is marked out just enough to
enable you to read a head with ease. Only certain areas are mapped out; the
rest of the head may be the location of bumps, but it does not present the
bumps which are likely to interest us just now.</p>

<p>The areas are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1.&mdash;<i>Lying at the top of the head, in the center and coming a little way
towards the forehead.</i> If this area is well developed, it shows that the individual
has a benevolent nature. He is generous and kind; he will work
for the good of others and not think only of himself.</p>

<p>If the area is over-developed, the individual will be inclined to favor others
at the expense of his own safety; if it is under-developed, he will be cruel
and selfish.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;<i>Situated above but a little behind the eye; usually the place is just
covered by hair.</i> When this area is well developed, it shows that the individual
possesses plenty of happiness and a store of wit and mirth. He is a
pleasant person, smiles on adversity and is excellent company.</p>

<p>If the area is over-developed, the individual is one who can never be
taken seriously, who pokes fun at everything; if it is under-developed, he is the
type of person who is never known to smile.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;<i>In the middle of the head, where it curves down towards the back of
the neck.</i> In cases where this area is well developed, the person is one who
has strength of mind; he is firm in his actions; he cannot be persuaded against
his own judgment; and he likes his own way.</p>

<p>If this area is over-developed, the person is obstinate and stubborn; if it
is under-developed, he is easily led, apt to waver and has not a mind of his
own.</p>

    <p>3&mdash;Firmness, Strength of Mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>4.&mdash;<i>In the middle of the head, lower down at the back than No. 3.</i> When
this area is found in a well-developed condition, the possessor is a person
who has dignity, self-esteem and proper pride. He is one who lives an
upright life because he puts a high price on these qualities.</p>

<p>If this area is over-developed, the individual is over-confident, he thinks
too much of himself and is haughty; if it lacks development, he is too humble
and suffers from an inferiority complex.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;<i>Lying beside Nos. 3 and 4.</i> To find this area well developed is a sure
sign that the possessor is a conscientious individual; it shows that he has a
high sense of duty, and his life will center around actions that are based on
what he thinks is right.</p>

<p>If this area is over-developed, the possessor will never progress far because
he will be always stopping and wondering whether what he proposes to
do is right; if under-developed, the possessor is one who does not care
whether what he does is wrong or right, so long as it brings him pleasure
and gain.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;<i>At the base of the skull, at the back, where it joins the backbone.</i> If
this area is well developed, it shows that the individual has the power of loving
somebody of the opposite sex in a proper manner. He or she will fall
in love when a suitable occasion arises and will make an excellent partner.</p>

<p>If this area is over-developed, the individual will be too passionate, will fall
in love with little or slight provocation, and will give himself or herself a
great deal of unhappiness; if under-developed, he or she will be too cold to
be moved by the thoughts of love.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;<i>A slight distance away from the back of the ear.</i> When this area is
well developed, the individual may be counted on to be courageously inclined.
He will not know the meaning of fear, and will not hold back because
troubles may be brewing.</p>

<p>If this area is over-developed, we have a quarrelsome person and if under-developed,
one who is afraid of his skin.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;<i>Beside No. 7, but more in the center of the back of the head.</i> Whenever
this area is properly developed, it shows that the possessor would make
an admirable husband or wife. He or she would be devoted, loyal and
attentive.</p>

<p>If the area is over-developed, the possessor has a jealous disposition; if
under-developed, he or she is fickle and apt to flirt with others.</p>

<p>9.&mdash;<i>Beside No. 8, in the center of the back of the head, low down.</i> Should
this area be well developed, it shows that the possessor has a proper love and
regard for children and that he thinks no person has experienced the fullest
joys of life who has not become a parent.</p>

<p>If this area is over-developed, the possessor thinks so much of children
that he spoils them; if it is under-developed, he is of the type that "cannot
stand them at any price."</p>

<h2>HOW ASTROLOGY DECIDES YOUR DESTINY</h2>
</div>


<p>Astrology is one of the oldest sciences in the world. It is said to have
originated with the Egyptians, almost at the very beginning of time. Indeed,
it is almost impossible to trace a period when this science was not practiced.</p>

<p>There is nothing new under the sun, and its close followers will scarcely
allow any errors in its deductions. They go so far as to declare it to be an
exact science, a term which means that everything can be reasoned out and
proved; nothing is left to guesswork.</p>

<p>Such sciences are Mathematics, Algebra, and Geometry. We need not
believe that Astrology is all this, but certainly some very startling and accurate
predictions have been made by astrologers.</p>

<p>However, as in all other methods of fortunetelling attempted by us mortals,
it is far from infallible. So long as we do not take it to be exact and sure,
we shall get plenty of amusement and interest from its study, with the exciting
feeling all the time at the back of our minds that "it might come true."</p>

<p>Here is a list giving you the names and meanings given to planets by
astrologers.</p>

<p>The main idea at the back of astrology is that the planets (or starry
bodies which revolve round the sun) each have a strong and varying influence
upon the minds of human beings.</p>

<p><i>THE ZODIAC.</i>&mdash;Of course when the planets revolve round the sun they
travel through a course or path. The Zodiac is the name given by astronomers
to the boundary which encloses this course or path in the sky.</p>

<p>The signs of the Zodiac are the spaces into which the Zodiac is divided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Here are the signs of the Zodiac arranged in order to show which signs are
opposite to each other.</p>

<p>Now each sign has a planet which is said to rule it; this is called the ruling
planet. It is from the nature of this planet that the probable character
and fate of the individual are told. It is not necessary to know the whys and
wherefores of this, if you have not studied astronomy it will only serve to
muddle you, and if, on the other hand, you do understand astronomy you will
not need any explanation. We will just say what does happen, and that
will tell you all you need in these first steps.</p>

<p>Well, we all know that the earth revolves upon its axis once in every 24
hours. Now, according to astronomers, this causes one of the Zodiac signs
to appear in the eastern sky, where it remains for two hours. We have said
that each sign has a planet ruling it, so the sign that appears on the sky at
the time of birth decides what planet that person is born under or is influenced
by.</p>

<p>Let us suppose for a moment that you were born when the sign Libra
was rising, as the saying is. The planet which rules Libra is Venus, so the
person born at that time would be a Venus type, i.e., a person having the
influence of Venus upon him.</p>

<p>In addition to the main ruling planet, astrologers will tell you that there
are other "neighboring" planets&mdash;we will call them neighboring because it is
a simple term&mdash;which also have their effect upon us. Astrologers call this one
planet being "in aspect" with another. For instance, you might have the
planet Mars in aspect with (or influenced by) the planet Saturn; you would
then be dealing with a very strong character.</p>

<p>The qualities of Mars which give the fighter and the pushing type, or in
excess the bully, will be well steadied by the qualities of Saturn, which by
themselves give coldness and, in excess, lack of feeling. The two together
result in a character remarkable for its steadiness combined with its never-wearying
energy and good balance.</p>

<p>So you see, we seldom find pure types (i.e., qualities of Mars, or other
planets by themselves), and it is very fortunate that this is so; we should get
a very one-sided world if we did.</p>

<p>Now we come to that part of Astrology which really interests most people;
here will be shown the birth-dates for each month in the year and the
probable characters of persons born at that special time. You may ask why
the characters are given and why not the fate or future of the person concerned.
The reason is this: you can be pretty sure that what you read of an
individual's character will give you a sound idea of what in all probability
his future will be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>After all, the carving out of our lives is in our own hands. We are the
masters of our fate, or as the song has it, "Captain of our Soul."</p>

<p>However, if we believe astrologers, there is a way to tell the times of our
lives when matters should go smoothly or the reverse. The most favorable
times for speculating with money, starting in business, in fact, the most
and least favorable periods of our lives can, according to astrology, be
worked out by what is known as the Horoscope.</p>

<p>Now this Horoscope is in reality a chart of your life. The rocky waters
are shown, and the barrier reefs which each of us must avoid through our
life, so you will see a use in the study of astrology. It would seem to be
Nature's warning to us all of the necessity for effort, effort and again effort.</p>

<p>Here are the birth dates and characteristics of persons born between the
dates mentioned. Since astrology is not infallible, do not take all these
characteristics too seriously.</p>

<p>You will notice that each date is taken from about the 20th of one month
to the 20th of the next month.</p>


<h3>WHEN WERE YOU BORN?</h3>


<h4 class="muted">Dec. 22nd to Jan. 20th.</h4>

<p>People born during this period have considerable mental ability and a keen
business instinct. They are fond of the imaginative arts. They are proud;
they like their own way and they see that they get it. Generally speaking,
they are better fitted to lead than to follow others.</p>

<p>However, they do not take kindly to changes of any kind, and are
annoyed by newfangled ideas. They do not want the advice of other
people and often resent it. They do not strike out in new directions and
they avoid taking risks. They lack "push."</p>

<p>To these people, we say:</p>

<p>Don't wait for opportunities&mdash;make them.</p>

<p>Don't let your pride persuade you to keep on the wrong road rather than
turn back.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid of admitting and correcting a mistake.</p>

<p>Don't run away from trouble; meet it with a bold front.</p>


<h4 class="muted">Jan. 21st to Feb. 19th.</h4>

<p>People born during this period have a strong sense of duty. They have a
kindly disposition and are inclined to be affectionate. They refuse to think
ill of anyone until the bad qualities are proved. Being straightforward themselves,
they imagine everyone else is the same and, on this account, they
are likely to suffer some bitter experiences.</p>

<p>However, they lack a proper regard for their own welfare. They are a
little too confiding and they are not adaptable. Once they make up their
minds on a matter, it is almost impossible to persuade them to change it.</p>

<p>To these people we say:</p>

<p>Don't brood over troubles. Face the facts, fight them out, and then, forget
all about them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Don't be guided by impulses.</p>

<p>Don't neglect the financial side of things, if you want to succeed.</p>


<h4 class="muted">Feb. 20th to March 20th.</h4>

<p>People born during this period are just in their dealings, and would not
injure another willingly. Their code of honor is a strict one. They are
industrious and persistent. They endeavor to perform their share in making
the world a better and a happier place.</p>

<p>However, they are too cautious and do not take sufficient risks to make
life a complete success. Too often, they ask themselves whether they should
go ahead with a project and, while they are hesitating, the opportune
moment flies away.</p>

<p>To these people, we say:</p>

<p>Don't listen to the voice of despair.</p>

<p>Don't be downhearted, if you don't see, at first, the way to do a thing.</p>

<p>Don't think in small things. Think large.</p>


<h4 class="muted">March 21st to April 19th.</h4>

<p>People born during this period are thoughtful. They are artistic, are fond
of the fine arts, and like all that is beautiful. They are self-willed and rebel
when others try to drive them. They do not take much notice of convention,
and the way of the world means nothing to them.</p>

<p>However, they are apt to shrink from disagreeable work, and everything
sordid disgusts them. They are too sensitive and take offense too readily.</p>

<p>To these people, we say:</p>

<p>Don't set yourself against the world: you will lose if you do.</p>

<p>Don't tire of your task before it is done.</p>

<p>Don't be too thin-skinned.</p>

<p>Don't forget that it takes all sorts of people to make up the world.</p>


<h4 class="muted">April 20th to May 20th.</h4>

<p>People born during this period possess a warm and generous heart. They
are good workers and display a genuine interest in everything they undertake.
They possess the kind of mind that seems to act instinctively and which does
not depend so much on real reason. They are lavish in gifts and kindness.</p>

<p>However, they are liable to rush to extremes, and they lack balance.
Consequently, they are easily misled.</p>

<p>To these people, we say:</p>

<p>Don't get excited unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Don't be too easily persuaded.</p>

<p>Don't allow your emotions to master you.</p>


<h4 class="muted">May 21st to June 21st.</h4>

<p>People born during this period are ambitious and they aspire to very high
things. They are sensitive and sympathetic. They have lively imaginations
and they are given to building castles in the air. They are naturally eloquent
and are never at a loss for something to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>However, they are rarely content with things as they find them. Consequently,
they grumble a great deal. They do not weigh up the "pros
and cons" before deciding on a matter; and they jump to conclusions.</p>

<p>To these people, we say:</p>

<p>Don't be discouraged too quickly.</p>

<p>Dream if you like, but don't neglect to translate your dreams into realities.</p>

<p>Don't be too enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Don't forget that work rather than plans win a home.</p>


<h4 class="muted">June 22nd to July 22nd.</h4>

<p>People born during this period are highly generous and they make sacrifices
in order to help others. They do nothing in a half-hearted way, whether
it is work or play. They are persevering and the home is put before anything
else.</p>

<p>However, they dislike changes which mean an alteration in domestic
life and they are a trifle old-fashioned in some of their beliefs. A little
flattery or persuasion is apt to lead them astray, and their better judgment
is rapidly overborne by a strong personality.</p>

<p>To these people, we say:</p>

<p>Don't dash headlong into anything.</p>

<p>Don't be irritable under contradiction.</p>

<p>Don't let your emotions run away with you.</p>

<p>Don't spoil your chances for a little show of love.</p>


<h4 class="muted">July 23rd to August 21st.</h4>

<p>People born during this period easily adapt themselves to circumstances,
and they are considered "jolly good company." They have "push" and
enterprise in a marked degree. They are affectionate, generous and highly
capable.</p>

<p>However, they lack a certain amount of self-control and they are not
always dependable. They frequently forget promises, and they are often
late in keeping appointments. In money affairs, they are likely to overlook
their obligations.</p>

<p>To these people, we say:</p>

<p>Don't let your emotions sweep you off your feet.</p>

<p>Don't become downcast too easily.</p>

<p>Don't be obstinate.</p>

<p>Don't make up your mind in a hurry.</p>


<h4 class="muted">August 22nd to Sept. 22nd</h4>

<p>People born during this month are well equipped for the battle of life,
and they have several qualities which should bring them success. They are
not easily flurried, and they know how to stand firm in an emergency. They
are quick in perceiving the correct thing to do, no matter what it is. They
are capable, dependable and thorough.</p>

<p>However, they are prone to be too independent, and they are apt to disregard
good advice, preferring their own judgment. They are not quick in
making friends because they are too wrapped up in themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>To these people, we say:</p>

<p>Don't take a plunge before reckoning up everything first.</p>

<p>Don't forget that there are two sides to every question. There is yours
and the other man's.</p>

<p>Don't fall into the habit of doing tomorrow what should be done today.</p>


<h4 class="muted">Sept. 23rd to Oct. 23rd.</h4>

<p>People born during this month are far-seeing and have excellent judgment.
They have a passion for "finding out" things, and they want to know about
everything that happens. Consequently, they are intelligent. They make
delightful companions.</p>

<p>However, they are bad losers, and they often let themselves get out of hand.
This seriously hurts their vanity, as they are exceedingly desirous of creating
a good impression.</p>

<p>To these people, we say:</p>

<p>Don't speak until you have thought twice.</p>

<p>Don't be obstinate. Admit you are wrong when you know you are.</p>

<p>Don't abuse your opponent.</p>


<h4 class="muted">Oct. 24th to Nov. 22nd.</h4>

<p>People born during this month possess great ambition, and are persevering.
They are full of energy and passionate spirit. One rebuff does not stop
them; they return to the fray again and again, until they have conquered.
They are precise in their actions, neat, methodical and tidy.</p>

<p>However, they are domineering, and endeavor to impose their will on
others. They lack discrimination and, once they conceive a hatred, there is
nothing which can dispel it.</p>

<p>To these people, we say:</p>

<p>Don't domineer.</p>

<p>Don't do things when you feel resentful.</p>

<p>Don't forget that prim and proper things sometimes defeat their own ends.</p>


<h4 class="muted">Nov. 23rd to Dec. 21st.</h4>

<p>People born during this month are, usually, virile and full of go and
enterprise. They have more will power than the average and know how
to surmount obstacles. Nothing comes amiss to them, and they are self-reliant.</p>

<p>However, they are inclined to quarrel with those who offer advice. They
carry independence too far, and they often speak without realizing the
significance of their words. They seldom confide in others.</p>

<p>To these people, we say:</p>

<p>Don't act or speak and then think. Think first.</p>

<p>Don't be obstinate and think you are being determined.</p>

<p>Don't be headstrong and disregard advice that is disinterested.</p>

<p>Don't be carried away by fickle fancies.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>YOUR CHILD'S OCCUPATION DECIDED
BY THE STARS</h2>
</div>


<p>It is a well-known fact that every human being is considerably influenced,
as far as character and capabilities are concerned, by the time of the year in
which he or she was born. That being so, it follows that the occupation best
suited to any particular individual is, in a measure, related to his or her
birth-date.</p>

<p>Parents who are anxious to do the best for their children should take note
of these conditions; they may be helpful in keeping round pegs out of square
holes. Below, we offer suggestions which have proved of use in thousands
of cases, where doubt had previously existed. The information may be used
in this way: Suppose a child is about to leave school and is ready to make his
or her entry into the world of work. In a number of cases, the child has
a very definite idea of what he or she wants to do. If the work is reasonably
suited to the child's temperament, station in life, and so on, it is much the
best plan to allow him or her to follow the particular bent. It is just as
well to note whether the chosen occupation fits in with the work which we
list below for his or her individual birth-date. If it approximates to some
occupation which we mention, well and good. Let the child go ahead,
there is every chance of success. But, if it is quite alien to anything which
is given in the list, caution is needed. We do not say that the child's ambition
should be checked and that he or she should be put to a job of our selection,
but we do say that caution ought to be exercised. We are perfectly ready to
admit that the stars and the birth-date are not the only factors which count.
Environment, upbringing, the father's occupation, and other things must influence
the child. All these influences should be weighed and carefully
considered.</p>

<p>But where astrology and the stars can give most help is in the case of a
boy or girl who has no formulated idea as to what he or she wants to
become. Thousands of children reach the school-leaving age without showing
the slightest inkling for any particular job. To the parents of such children,
we say, consult the lists set out below, seeing that they are based on astrological
teachings. Go over the selected occupations carefully, discuss them with the
child, explain what they offer in terms of money, work, hours, etc., and watch
the effect they have on the child. In this way, it will soon be possible to
gain an idea as to what occupation should be eventually decided on.</p>

<p>Here are the occupations suitable for each person:</p>

<p><i>CAPRICORN BORN</i> (Dec. 22nd to Jan. 20th).&mdash;Since people born in
this period have considerable mental ability, it follows that they do well in
most of the professions, since they can pass the necessary examinations and
become well qualified. Thus, they ought to do satisfactorily in medicine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the law, dentistry, the scholastic profession and similar occupations. The
fact that they do not care to take risks unfits them for many business openings,
but where aspirations are not high, they do well as clerks and in filling
posts which consist of routine work. Girls, especially, should seek work which
is connected with the imaginative arts.</p>

<p><i>AQUARIAN BORN</i> (Jan. 21st to Feb. 19th).&mdash;Boys display a good deal
of interest in occupations which require the use of their hands. This makes
them capable in many engineering posts, in wireless, in cabinet-making and
similar jobs. They are not good at creating or inventing in connection with
these industries, however. There is the roving disposition implanted in
these boys and many of them think that the pilot's job on an air liner could
not be equalled.</p>

<p>Girls are, also, interested in working with their hands: thus they are fitted
for dressmaking, the millinery trade, for dealing with arts and crafts supplies,
etc. A certain number are eminently suited to secretarial work.</p>

<p><i>PISCEAN BORN</i> (Feb. 20th to March 20th).&mdash;Children born in this
period have a love for the sea and, therefore, the boys find congenial work as
ship's mates, stewards, marine engineers, etc., while girls are suitable for
stewardesses and other jobs filled by women on ocean-going vessels.</p>

<p>In addition boys and girls are both fitted to all kinds of work in shops,
chain stores, etc., but they are not at their best when managing their
own businesses. They require authority behind them.</p>

<p>A few Pisceans have artistic ability which should lead them to do splendidly
as authors, painters, musicians, etc.</p>

<p><i>ARIES BORN</i> (March 21st to April 19th).&mdash;The Aries child is often a
problem, for certain of them have a rooted objection to anything in the
nature of routine work. They chafe at going and coming at the same hour
each day, and of doing the same work year after year. It is not that they
are lazy, but that their nature refuses to be driven by set rules. With such
children, it is wisest to interest them in whatever they fancy, until the time
comes when they launch out on some brilliant scheme of their own. Aries
men are the ones that fill unusual, out-of-the-way posts.</p>

<p>Where this rooted objection does not exist, the children are good in almost
any position which permits of movement, as travellers, for instance.</p>

<p><i>TAURIAN BORN</i> (April 20th to May 20th).&mdash;As a rule, children who
are Taurians are very successful. They do not mind hard work and they
have a "flair" for doing the right thing, without knowing why. They have
a head for figures and money, and thus do well in banks and stockbroker's
offices. They take kindly to long training, which enables them to succeed
in law and medicine.</p>

<p>Both boys and girls are good with their hands. This makes them successful
in a large number of occupations, as widely diverse as engineering and
tailoring, or hairdressing and piano playing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><i>GEMINI BORN</i> (May 21st to June 21st).&mdash;Gemini children show a
good deal of ambition, and their chief fault is that they object to beginning
at the bottom of the ladder. Perhaps this is useful, in a way, as it goads
them on to climbing upwards. They have a good deal of vision. Thus
they make excellent newspaper men and women. They do well in new
trades, notably in radio and the motor world. Also, they ought to make a
success in certain branches of aviation. Their eloquence fits them admirably
for travellers, and they would make their mark in any business which,
eventually, gave them work of an imaginative nature. In a general way,
they find interest in theatrical work, in literary activities and in architecture.
All Gemini people have a streak in their natures which causes them to
seek unnecessary changes.</p>

<p><i>CANCER BORN</i> (June 22nd to July 22nd).&mdash;Children born during this
period are usually "workers." They will plod, they do not mind long hours,
and they will set themselves to difficult jobs, if told to get on with them.
As a rule, they should be set to something which enables them to work
"on their own." They much prefer this to being a small peg in a large
machine. They are suited to small businesses and agencies. A mail-order
business might fit in with their requirements. Girls would do well as private
teachers, running small schools of their own. They are, also, suited to the
drapery trade.</p>

<p><i>LEO BORN</i> (July 23rd to August 21st).&mdash;Those who are born during
this period succeed best in what might be called "clean" occupations. The
boys do not want to put on overalls and become grimy, and the girls prefer
work that enables them to be always neat and tidy. Both of them show
aptitude in marketing such things as jewelry, drugs, books and clothes,
but they do not want to be concerned with making them. They are not so
much interested in vending the necessaries of life as the luxuries. Thus,
motor cars, victrolas, cameras, sports requisites, etc., attract them.</p>

<p>They are not much suited to clerical work, but a good number find an
outlet for their ambitions in the theatrical and literary world, while a few
make good dentists, radiologists and medical practitioners.</p>

<p><i>VIRGO BORN</i> (Aug. 22nd to Sept. 22nd).&mdash;These children are capable,
but their great failing is that, once they find a fairly suitable post, they will
not look for anything better. They prefer to hold on to a moderate certainty
than to risk a little for a great success. Consequently, Virgo-born are found
living on salaries just sufficient to keep them from want.</p>

<p>They are eminently suited to clerical work of the higher types, such as
in banks, insurance companies, stockbrokers' offices, etc. They make good
company secretaries, excellent journalists, fairly good actors and actresses,
and the girls do well as teachers.</p>

<p><i>LIBRA BORN</i> (Sept. 23rd to October 23rd).&mdash;Children of this period
do not mind hard work, but they hate monotony, especially if it is at all
sordid. They have good judgment, a quality which fits them for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
diverse occupations as medicine and the drama, the law and dressmaking.
No special trades or professions can be singled out for them; but, as long as
they are set to work in a direction which provides them with an outlet for
a nicely balanced judgment and a capacity for what might be termed the
detective instinct, they should succeed admirably.</p>

<p><i>SCORPIO BORN</i> (Oct. 24th to Nov. 22nd).&mdash;There is an abundance of
ambition in these children, and they seek position rather than money. Thus,
the boys do well in the Navy and the Army, and, in a less degree, in the
Air Force. The Church holds out good openings for many of them, and
the Mercantile Marine interest not a few. Medicine attracts both boys and
girls, and so does the stage. Anything to do with chemicals seems to influence
many of the boys. Scorpio-born children are often heard to say that they
want to make a name for themselves.</p>

<p><i>SAGITTARIAN BORN</i> (Nov. 23rd to Dec. 21st).&mdash;Children of this
period are fond of animals; thus they are suited to become veterinary surgeons,
horse-dealers, farmers and even jockeys. One section of them, having excessive
will power and plenty of self-reliance, makes a type of individual who
seeks publicity in the political world. All are capable in business, especially
in the executive branches. Not a few men become company promoters,
chairmen and directors. The girls make excellent teachers and welfare
workers.</p>

<h2>WHAT IS YOUR LUCKY NUMBER?</h2>
</div>


<p>Once more from the rising sun of the East further marvelous theories
have reached us through the paths of the ages. To many of our prosaic
Western minds, maybe not unnaturally, these ideas will at first sight appear
almost ridiculous. However, do not condemn numerical mysteries unheard,
for no Manual of Fortunetelling would be complete should it not include
a talk on this most arresting subject.</p>

<p>Students of numbers, as do astrologers and students of palmistry, declare
that there is no such thing as luck or chance in the world. They also state
that we are strongly but not inevitably influenced by certain powerful laws
of Nature.</p>

<p>Number science is certainly unknown to the great majority of us, but
there are some superstitions which are based on evil numbers; these superstitions
we treat with great respect. Very few of us really care to sit down
thirteen at table, while I have known a man go sad and smokeless rather
than be the third to light his cigarette off one match!</p>

<p>Fortunetelling by numbers is allied to astrology very closely indeed. Let
us now take each day of the week individually and see what information
we can get from it. You will find that very useful as a check upon your
other forms of fortunetelling.</p>


<h3>ON WHAT DAY WERE YOU BORN?</h3>

<p>If, as I suggested, we take the days of the week we shall find that they
in turn are influenced by the order in which they are found, or by the
number which is theirs. For instance, Sunday being the first day, is
influenced by No. 1, and Friday, being the sixth day takes No. 6 as its ruling
number.</p>

<p>According to the ancients each number has its corresponding planet; here is
a little table showing the planet representing and ruling over each number.</p>

<table class="borderless" summary="Planets Ruling Over Numbers">
<tr>
<td class="tdc">No. 0.</td>

<td class="tdl">Represented by Neptune.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Taking each day of the week in order, we find the following characteristics.</p>


<h3>TABLE OF DAYS IN WEEK</h3>

<p>No. 1 (<i>Sunday</i>).&mdash;You will see by your table that this day takes the Sun
for its ruler&mdash;Sun-day. It is a fortunate day; persons born on a Sunday have
a brave and honest influence on them. They will be optimistic, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
foolishly so, while at the same time they have great pride in the reputation
of themselves and their families. If they have any fault it is, maybe, that this
pride is felt, a little too strongly; they may be inclined to take themselves
rather too seriously. However, I repeat, this is an excellent day.</p>

<p>No. 2 (<i>Monday</i>).&mdash;This day is the Moon-day. The lesson for Monday
men to learn is steadiness. They are too easily influenced and are blown
hither and thither upon life's winds. They adapt themselves well to change
of place, circumstances, scene, and frequently follow the sea. They have
plenty of imagination in their natures, and should cultivate common sense.</p>

<p>No. 3 (<i>Tuesday</i>).&mdash;The day of Mars (French&mdash;Mardi). Frequently the
engineers of the world. An ambitious go-ahead day is Tuesday. These
Tuesday folk are the explorers, the men who emigrate, and the earnest
patriots of life. Soldiers, workers at the furnace among other workers, are
found among those born on Tuesday. Their womenfolk are inclined to be
rather shrewish and domineering. They are not naturally good managers,
and should cultivate this quality because they are always rare workers.</p>

<p>No. 4 (<i>Wednesday</i>).&mdash;The table tells us that these are the Mercurians.
The men are quick at calculating figures, and always capable and thoughtful
workers. Mercury, as its name implies, gives quickness, with business trading
capacity. The women appear not to be so favorably influenced, they
must guard against grumbling and gossip; then they may do well enough.</p>

<p>No. 5 (<i>Thursday</i>).&mdash;Under the planet of Jupiter, these Thursday people
have many good qualities. They are liberal and good natured, but have one
vice&mdash;the outcome of their virtue. They are inclined to be too liberal with
themselves, which is extravagance. Given an idea they can turn it to good
account, but do not, as a rule, originate ideas. Statesmen are here found;
let these Jupiterians beware of a love of display and what is commonly
known as side. Then they are very excellent people indeed.</p>

<p>No. 6 (<i>Friday</i>).&mdash;Look at the table&mdash;see Venus is the planet of Friday.
This accounts for many things. Here we see the typical Venus type. Gay,
light-hearted, with no thought of the morrow, they flit happily through life
like a gilded butterfly upon the wing. If they lack taste they over-dress.
Their good qualities are their charming personalities, pleasing manners, and
a quick command of music and art. They should beware of being only
butterflies, and should cultivate strength of character. They should also
obtain by hook or by crook a liking for hard work; it will serve them in
good stead.</p>

<p>No. 7 (<i>Saturday</i>).&mdash;Saturday, as its name tells us, has sad Saturn for its
planet. Here we have the exact opposite to the persons mentioned who were
born on a Friday. Saturday people miss half the joy of living by their cold
and calculating natures. Careful with money, they are patient workers,
they must beware of being miserly, and should certainly cultivate their
missing sense of humor. The good qualities in these people are their
sincerely earnest outlook and their capacity for an almost endless grind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
hard work. Their womenfolk frequently make old maids and should practice
sweet temper and a kindly feeling towards the rest of the household.</p>


<h3>YOUR OWN NUMBER</h3>

<p>But there is much more in the science of numbers than that which can
be gleaned from the days of the week. There is your own personal number,
the number which influences you and your actions more than any other.
If you know your number, think how you can use it for good and avoid
others for ill! The finding of your number is a simple matter when you
have mastered the elements of numerology, which is the science of numbers.</p>

<p>Let us explain how your own number is found. First, write down your
birth-date, the day of the month, the month itself and the year. Thus, three
items are required. Take first the day of the month. If it consists of one
figure, leave it. If it consists of two, add them together, and, if the answer
comes to two figures, add them together. All this may appear a little involved,
but it is not, as one or two examples will show.</p>

<p>Suppose you were born on the 9th of the month, then 9 is the number
you want.</p>

<p>But, suppose it was the 16th, then six and one make seven. Therefore
7 is the required number.</p>

<p>Again, if you were born on the 29th, then nine and two make eleven, but
as eleven consists of two figures, you must add them together, and they
make 2.</p>

<p>So much for the day of the month, now for the month itself. January
stands for one, February for 2, and so on, to December for 12. The numbers
of the months from January to September can stand as they are, but October
November and December, being 10, 11 and 12, must be added up, as already
described. Thus October is one, November is two and December three.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the number of the year must be considered. Say you were born
in 1910. These figures add up to eleven, and eleven, being double figures,
adds up to 2. Therefore 1910 is equivalent to 2.</p>

<p>Work out your figures here.</p>

<p>You have now obtained three separate figures, add them together and if
they come to a one-figure number, that is the number which you require.
On the other hand, if it is a double-figured amount, add the two figures
as before, until you arrive at a single-figured amount. Then that is the
number you require.</p>

<p>So as to make the whole thing perfectly clear, we will take a complete
example and work it out, exactly as you must work out your own birth-date.</p>

<div class="center">
  <div class="centerindent">
    <p><i>Example.</i>&mdash;12th September, 1913.</p>

    <p>12 = 1 + 2 = 3<br />
    September is the 9th month = 9<br />
    1913 = 1 + 9 + 1 + 3 = 14 = 1 + 4 = 5<br />
    3 + 9 + 5 = 17 = 1 + 7 = 8
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, the personal number of anyone born on 12th September, 1913,
is 8. Eight should guide and influence all his or her actions. We are not
going to pretend that benefits will accrue on every occasion that the personal
number is observed, but we are going to say that we have noted some
marvelous pieces of good fortune when it has.</p>

<p>When you have found your personal number, there are several ways in
which you can use it. Suppose your number is the one just found, eight;
then you can conclude that the eighth day of any month will be a propitious
one for you. But that is not the only one. The 17th is equally good,
because one plus seven gives eight. Moreover, the 26th is in a similar
position. Two and six make eight.</p>

<p>Yet another way to use your personal number arises when you want to
know whether some important step should be taken on a definite day. What
is the particular day? Add up its numerological values, exactly as you did
with your birthday, and if it resolves itself into the same number as your
personal number, you may go ahead with cheerfulness. Put forth your
best effort, and, on the day, you will have ample chances of success.</p>


<h3>THE NUMBER OF YOUR NAME</h3>

<p>Numerology permits of still another step. Take your own name and see
what number it is equal to. You will be able to do this in the following
way: A stands for one, B for two, C for three, and so on. When you reach
I, which is 9, commence again and give J the value of one, then continue.
To make all this clear, we will set out the values of the complete alphabet:</p>
<div class="center">

<p class="numerology">
1 = A   J   S<br />
2 = B   K   T<br />
3 = C   L   U<br />
4 = D   M   V<br />
5 = E   N   W<br />
6 = F   O   X<br />
7 = G   P   Y<br />
8 = H   Q   Z<br />
9 = I   R   &mdash;
</p>
</div>

<p>Thus, suppose your name is Joan Shirley, the letters resolve themselves
into the following numbers:&mdash;</p>

<p class="numerology-math">
J   O   A   N   S   H   I   R   L   E   Y<br />
1 + 6 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 55<br />
55 = 5 + 5 = 10 = 1 + 0 = 1
</p>

<p>From all that we have said, it will be clear that the birthdate may be used
for finding the personal number, or the letters of the name may be used. On
rare occasions, the two ways will provide the same number. When this is
the case, great faith should be placed in that number. But, when the two
ways give different numbers, what? Does one disprove the other? No. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
simply have two numbers favorable to you. The birthdate number is the
more definite and reliable because your very existence is based on it.</p>

<p>A word at the end. Married ladies must use their maiden name for
finding the name number.</p>


<h3>DO YOU KNOW THAT</h3>

<p><i>Odd Numbers</i> have always been credited with mystic powers capable of
influencing the destinies of people; and a curious survival of the idea is to
be found in the fact that countrywomen, without knowing why, put an odd
number of eggs under their hens in the belief that otherwise no chickens
will be hatched?</p>

<p>In addition, we have noticed that books of sweepstake tickets generally
have the odd-numbered tickets withdrawn from them before the even-numbered
ones.</p>

<p><i>Number Three.</i>&mdash;This number comes in for a considerable share of popularity,
even from mythological times, when there were the three fates and
the three graces. Shakespeare introduced three witches in "Macbeth." In
nursery rhymes, we have the three blind mice. In public-house signs, we
frequently come across the numeral "three," and, of course, pawnbrokers
have three brass balls.</p>

<p><i>Number Seven.</i>&mdash;Seven is deemed extremely lucky, it being the perfect or
mystic number which runs the entire scheme of the Universe in matters
physical and spiritual. Man's life is popularly divided into seven ages: the
product of seven and nine&mdash;sixty-three&mdash;was regarded as the grand climacteric,
and the age was considered as a most important stage of life.</p>

<p>The seventh son of a seventh son, according to Highland belief, possesses
the gift of second sight, and the power of healing the sick. Many people
believe that a cycle of seven years of misfortune is likely to be succeeded
by another of prosperity.</p>

<p><i>Number Nine</i> is credited with mystic properties, good and bad. A piece of
wool with nine knots tied in it is a well-known charm for a sprained ankle.
The cat o'nine tails is a form of punishment not to be taken lightly.</p>

<p><i>Number Thirteen.</i>&mdash;Of this number, everybody can supply instances when
it has brought bad luck. But it may be cheering to mention that, in certain
parts of the world, thirteen is regarded in quite a favorable light. Whether
it is good or bad is a matter for each individual to decide.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>YOUR LUCKY COLOR</h2>
</div>


<p>The old saying, "green for grief," is a well-known one, and the writer
would rather wear any color on earth than green, not even a green scarf or
belt. Moreover, she sees to it that the other members of the family do not
indulge in the unlucky color. But mind you, green only brings her ill-fortune
when used for wearing apparel. There is no objection, of course, to a green
front-door nor to wallpaper of the same color. For such uses, green plays
its part harmlessly enough.</p>

<p>Though green dresses are more distressing to the writer than a red rag
to a bull, she is quite prepared to admit that many people find it a very
lucky color. This brings us to the point. There is no color that is universally
unlucky; it is only so in the hands of certain individuals. With
others, it may be an absolute harbinger of all that is lucky. Even green may
do this.</p>

<p>Now the question is, "Which is your lucky color?" If you know it, well
and good. Make use of it in every possible way. When wearing dresses
made of it, you will feel more confident of yourself than when arrayed in
something else. You will get more work done, and it will be better work.
The only thing is that you must be sure that it is your lucky color. If you
are not quite sure, the tonic effect is absolutely lost.</p>

<p>Not only should you wear your fortunate color, but it is a good plan
to surround yourself with it. We know a woman who pins her faith to
purple. Her dresses are mostly purple; the wallpaper in her bedroom is
purple; purple casement curtains adorn the windows; there are purple rugs
in various parts of the house; even the back of the hair-brush on her dressing
table is purple. And, since she decided that purple was her lucky color and
used it in every reasonable way, she has had several strokes of marvelous
good fortune.</p>

<p>But, of course, you may say in reply to all this that you do not know
your lucky color. What then? This is where we can give you a little help.
Most people's lucky color depends on the time of their birth and the following
list sets out the birth colors. We know full well that everybody does not
derive good fortune from his birth color, but that they find it in some other
hue. Therefore, the proper course is to make trials with the appropriate
color listed below and, if that does not answer satisfactorily, to choose another
of your own liking and try that. Only by personal experiment can you
finally decide the point.</p>

<p>These are the birth-colors. The first given for any period is the one almost
universally accepted. Those following after the first are, however, favored
by a certain number of people.</p>

<h2>WHICH IS YOUR LUCKY STONE?</h2>
</div>


<p>Ever since time began, it has been a common belief that people derived
luck and good fortune by wearing precious stones. A stone, however, that
brought luck to one person might be ineffective when worn by someone else.
Thus everybody is required to find out which stone he or she must wear in
order to enjoy the utmost good fortune.</p>

<p>As a rule, the stone which any particular person must choose is decided
by the month in which that individual was born. But this it not invariably
the case. Many people have noticed that luck has come to them when they
have been wearing some other stone than that decreed by their birth-month.
And, of course, the opposite has often happened. History records a well-known
case in point. The Hope diamond, for instance, wrecked the lives
of several royal personages, even including some that were born in April;
while an opal, possessed by members of the Spanish royal family, brought
disaster to many people, one after the other, although certain of them were
born in October.</p>

<p>Clearly, then, the proper thing is for all of us to choose our lucky stone
according to our own preferences; but failing any definite preference to
select it according to the month of our birth.</p>


<h3>STONES OF THE MONTHS</h3>

<h3>AN ABC OF PRECIOUS STONES</h3>

<p><i>AGATE.</i>&mdash;A stone, showing irregular bands of browns and yellows, which
is often known as onyx, cornelian, etc. It is supposed to have special powers
in making and binding friendships, Also, it insures long life, health and
prosperity for those born in June.</p>

<p><i>AMBER.</i>&mdash;A brownish material, resembling stone, which is derived from
fossilized pine trees. It provides health and happiness when worn round
the neck by people born in August.</p>

<p><i>AMETHYST.</i>&mdash;A form of quartz, showing a range of color-shades from
purple to lilac. Originally it was worn by the Greeks as a preventive of
drunkenness, and, then, as a cure for all excesses of passion. Later, it became
the stone associated with St. Valentine. This immediately constituted it the
particular charm for lovers. It is the February birthstone.</p>

<p><i>AQUAMARINE.</i>&mdash;A bluish-green form of the beryl or topaz. As the name
implies, sea-water, it has long been a mascot for sailors and for those setting
out on a long sea journey. It stands for faithfulness: thus it is an appropriate
stone for a bridegroom to give to his wife, as a wedding gift.</p>

<p><i>BERYL.</i>&mdash;A pale green stone which is sometimes found with a yellowish
tinge. The latter is known as the gold beryl. It is avoided by many people
as it stands for doubt, uncertainty and qualities of a wavering nature.</p>

<p><i>BLOODSTONE.</i>&mdash;A stone found with many different colorings and
markings. A frequent variety has a greenish surface, sprinkled with patches
of vivid red: whilst a totally different variety shows a mottling of red and
brown, with streaks of green. The red markings suggested the name of
"bloodstone," and the blood became a symbol of bravery, strength and the
powers of fighting. Thus, it is a stone to be worn by a man, rather than
a lady. In olden days, the women gave bloodstones to their menfolk before
going into battle.</p>

<p><i>CARBUNCLE.</i>&mdash;Garnets, when given a round or oval shape, with the
surface domed and not cut into facets, are so called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p><i>CHRYSOLITE.</i>&mdash;A form of beryl, generally found in colors ranging from
olive-green to amber-orange. It is a stone for the September-born and is
supposed to banish evil passions and sadness of mind.</p>

<p><i>CORAL.</i>&mdash;A reddish stone, formed by a microscopic animal living in sea
water. It is used chiefly for beads. Children wearing such beads are said
to be preserved from dangers, whilst married women are ensured a life of
happiness. Its powers are chiefly applied to those born in November.</p>

<p><i>DIAMOND.</i>&mdash;A pure form of carbon, water-white in color. The largest
known diamond was given to Edward VII, by the Transvaal government in
1907. It weighs one and three-quarter pounds, and is known as the Cullinan
diamond. This precious stone is considered to be a symbol of strength and
virtue. In olden days, the leaders wore it when going into battle to safeguard
their courage. It should be worn on the left side and is the month
stone of April.</p>

<p><i>EMERALD.</i>&mdash;This is a delightful variety of green beryl. It has, normally,
a brilliant appearance, which is supposed to dwindle should either the giver
or the receiver become unfaithful to the other. It stands as a symbol for
kindness and true love. It is the month-stone of May.</p>

<p><i>GARNET.</i>&mdash;A ruby-colored stone in the usual form, but there are brown,
yellow, green and black varieties. It stands for constancy and fidelity and is
the month-stone of January.</p>

<p><i>JADE.</i>&mdash;A very hard stone, usually a rich green, but there are white and
other varieties. The Chinese considered that those who wore it would be
assured a long and contented life.</p>

<p><i>JASPER.</i>&mdash;An ornamental form of quartz, varying from a reddish-brown
to a brownish-black, usually streaked with other colors. It is particularly
hard, and this makes it a symbol of firmness and endurance.</p>

<p><i>LAPIS LAZULI.</i>&mdash;This heavenly blue stone is worn as a sign of truth
and honesty. The ancients considered that it would charm away certain
diseases.</p>

<p><i>MOONSTONE.</i>&mdash;Sometimes called the water opal, this whitish stone reflects
a bluish tinge. It is supposed to safeguard those who travel to distant
parts, especially if the journey is mostly by sea.</p>

<p><i>OLIVINE.</i>&mdash;A green form of chrysolite, which see.</p>

<p><i>ONYX.</i>&mdash;A form of agate in which the bandings of color are milk-white,
alternating with another hue. White and red bands produce the stone known
as the cornelian onyx: white and flesh colored bands, chalcedonyx: and white
and green bands, sardonyx. The latter is the month-stone of August and
stands for conjugal felicity.</p>

<p><i>OPAL.</i>&mdash;A semi-transparent stone, the most usual varieties being whitish
in color, but flashing various hues as the angle is changed. The opal has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
connected with more legends than, probably, any other stone. To some it is
a harbinger of bad luck, but most people agree that it is a stone that brings
good fortune to the wearer. It is the month-stone of October. Then it
denotes hope, it sharpens the sight and the faith of the possessor. It is
supposed to lose its flashing qualities when worn by the unfaithful.</p>

<p><i>PEARL.</i>&mdash;A pearl is a symbol of purity and perfection, and, when given
to a lady, is said to inspire her love.</p>

<p><i>PERIDOT.</i>&mdash;A form of olivine or chrysolite. See "Chrysolite."</p>

<p><i>PORPHYRY.</i>&mdash;A stone which usually shows light red or white spots on
a background of deep red. There are green varieties, however. This stone,
when given to a lady, is a tribute to her beauty.</p>

<p><i>RUBY.</i>&mdash;A stone of deep, clear carmine color, when at its best. It is the
month-stone of July, and is supposed to correct evils resulting from mistaken
friendships.</p>

<p><i>SAPPHIRE.</i>&mdash;A beautiful blue stone which is reserved for those born in
September. It is usually supposed to bring good fortune to those in love, but
some people hold that it is a symbol of repentance.</p>

<p><i>SARDONYX.</i>&mdash;See "Onyx."</p>

<p><i>TOPAZ.</i>&mdash;A glassy stone, red, blue, yellow or green in color; but amber is
the most usual. It is the stone for those born in November, and denotes
fidelity and friendship.</p>

<p><i>TURQUOISE.</i>&mdash;A waxy bluish-green stone. It belongs to those born in
December and stands for prosperity in love.</p>

<p><i>ZIRCON.</i>&mdash;It is a stone of lustrous grey-black color. It is a symbol of
sympathy.</p>

    should be perfectly dry. Then, with the assistance of a second
    spoon, tilt drops of tea into the balancing spoon and count
    them, one by one. The number of drops it takes to upset
    the spoon reveals the number of years that will elapse before
    the wedding takes place.</p>

<h2>LUCKY AND UNLUCKY DAYS</h2>
</div>


<p>Most of us have discovered that certain days of the week, or even the year,
are more favorable to us than others. But there are some people who have
not made this discovery. To them, the indications given in this chapter will
be of considerable interest.</p>

<p><i>Friday&mdash;an Unlucky Day.</i>&mdash;Fortunately, six of the seven days of the week
are charitably disposed towards the majority of us. Here and there, a person
may be found who affirms that Monday, Thursday or some other day never
did him or her a kindness; but such a remark is not general. Friday, however,
can be put on the black list, as it is a notoriously unlucky day. Most
men and women cherish a superstitious fear of it, and this opinion has
existed since the first Good Friday. Many will never embark upon any
enterprise of importance; there are fewer marriages on this day than any
other, and sailors are averse to sailing on Friday. Many are the tales they
tell of vessels which put to sea on a Friday, and were never heard of again.
If all the bank or financial crashes of the last century were counted up, it
would be found that Friday supplied the greatest number. A lengthy list
could be added to prove that Friday is a day of bad luck.</p>

<p>One good thing can be said for it, however&mdash;it favors its own: for people
born on a Friday are not affected by its evil disposition.</p>

<p><i>Unlucky Dates.</i>&mdash;In an old calendar, astrologers indicated the following
dates as unlucky. If any of them fell on a Friday, they were doubly unlucky:</p>

<p class="indent">
January 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 17, 29&mdash;very unlucky.<br />
February 26, 27, 28&mdash;unlucky; 8, 10, 17&mdash;very unlucky.<br />
March 16, 17, 20&mdash;very unlucky.<br />
April 7, 8, 10, 20&mdash;unlucky; 16 and 21&mdash;very unlucky.<br />
June 10 and 22&mdash;unlucky; 4 and 8&mdash;very unlucky.<br />
July 15 and 21&mdash;very unlucky.<br />
August 1, 29 and 30&mdash;unlucky; 19 and 20&mdash;very unlucky.<br />
September 2, 4, 21, 23&mdash;unlucky; 6 and 7&mdash;very unlucky.<br />
October 4, 16, 24&mdash;unlucky; 6, very unlucky.<br />
November 5, 6, 29, 30&mdash;unlucky; 15 and 20&mdash;very unlucky.<br />
December 15, 22&mdash;unlucky; 6, 7, and 9&mdash;very unlucky.
</p>

<p>These were regarded as perilous days to fall ill upon, to have an accident,
to be married, to start on a journey, or commence any work.</p>

<p>What is most striking about this list is that the "thirteenth" does not appear
on it at all, although most people will tell you that the thirteenth is the date
they avoid more than all others.</p>

<p><i>Lucky and Unlucky Dates depending on Birth-dates.</i>&mdash;Much the most
accurate way of determining which dates are lucky and unlucky is by using
the portents displayed by the Signs of the Zodiac. To do this, it is necessary
to know when the individual affected was born. The following is a list
worked out on these lines:</p>

<p>It should be noted in connection with the above figures that no birth-date
is unlucky. Thus, should any particular reader find that his birthday is given
as unlucky, he may transfer it immediately to the list of lucky dates. As an
example, take the last line of unlucky figures, given above. They are Dec.
6, 11, 18 and 28, and they operate for people born between Nov. 23rd and
Dec. 21st. Should a person born on Dec. 6th be consulting this list, the
only unlucky dates in December for him or her are Dec. 11, 18 and 28.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>THE LUCK OF FLOWERS</h2>
</div>


<p>It has been a favorite pastime with maidens in all ages to try to foretell
their future by the aid of flowers and plants.</p>

<p>One of the most popular fancies is provided by the four-leaved clover, the
story of which is told in various legends. One runs to the effect that three
beautiful sisters, Faith, Hope and Charity, came from over the seas, and
wherever they walked three-leaved clovers, crimson, white and yellow,
bloomed profusely. In their footsteps came another more beautiful being,
whose name was Love, and in his honor the clover added a fourth petal
to the trefoil.</p>

<p>In time, it became the talisman of love-sick maidens, who wore it in their
shoe to ensure a speedy meeting with their sweetheart, wore it over their
heart to frighten away evil spirits and to prevent being jilted. In the case
of a quarrel, it served to effect a reconciliation.</p>

<p>Apart from its sentimental associations, a four-leaved clover has long been
regarded as an emblem of good luck, and has been worn by those who
believe in such things when they wished to increase their chances of good
fortune.</p>

<p><i>SPRING FLOWERS.</i>&mdash;Naturally, many beliefs flourish around the flowers
of the garden and the hedgerow.</p>
<div class="indent">
    <p>If you chance to find the first flower of the season on a Monday, it means
    good luck.</p>

    <p>If on a Tuesday, big undertakings are likely to be successful.</p>

    <p>If on a Wednesday, it denotes your approaching wedding.</p>

    <p>If on a Thursday, hard work with little profit will fall to your lot.</p>

    <p>If on a Friday, unexpected wealth reaches you.</p>

    <p>If on a Saturday, you may look out for misfortune.</p>

    <p>If on a Sunday, phenomenal good luck will come to you.</p>
</div>
<p><i>THE FIRST WILD FLOWER.</i>&mdash;From the first wild flowers which you
gather in spring, it is possible to discover the initials of your future husband or
wife. If, for instance, they should chance to be daisies, violets and buttercups,
then expect to find some suitable person with the initials D. V. B.,
but they may not be necessarily in this order.</p>

<p>If someone presents you with a yellow flower, then you may expect a
gift of money directly.</p>

<p>If you can turn a bluebell inside out without breaking it, then your lover
will be true as long as both of you live.</p>

<img src="images/i_100.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 21.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>THE PANSY.</i>&mdash;If you wish to know your future destiny, pluck a pansy,
which takes its name from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pensee</i>, a thought. Count the streaks or lines upon
the petals.</p>

<div class="indent">
    <p>Four streaks tell that your dearest wish will be fulfilled.</p>

    <p>Five streaks stand for hope with fear.</p>

    <p>Six streaks suggest a surprise.</p>

    <p>Seven streaks tell of constancy in your lover.</p>

    <p>Eight streaks, fickleness.</p>

    <p>Nine streaks, a change and then riches.</p>

    <p>Markings leaning towards the left denote trouble.</p>

    <p>Markings leaning to the right denote prosperity.</p>

    <p>Should the central streak be the longest, then Sunday should be chosen
    as your wedding day.</p>
</div>

<p><i>THE DAISY.</i>&mdash;One of the oldest of flower charms is to pluck at the petals
of a daisy or marguerite. At first pluck, these words are said, "He loves
me"; at the second, "He loves me not." These sentences are repeated alternately
until the flower is deprived of all its petals. Whichever sentence
was uttered last describes "his" affections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p><i>THE IVY.</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container-left"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Ivy, ivy, I thee pluck,</div>
      <div class="verse">And in my bosom, I thee put.</div>
      <div class="verse">The first young man who speaks to me</div>
      <div class="verse">My own true lover he shall be.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="figcenter bigfig">
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 22.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>THE HAWTHORN OR MAY.</i>&mdash;Once upon a time, every porch was decorated
with a branch of May to avert the evil eye and prevent witchcraft, but the
idea has been departed from, and now it is regarded as a harbinger of
ill-luck, and is rarely brought inside a house.</p>

<p><i>THE MISTLETOE.</i>&mdash;From very ancient times, this plant has been regarded
with curious veneration. Probably it gained special fame, in the first instance,
owing to the peculiar manner in which it grew. The Druids looked
upon it as a plant possessing marvelous properties, and they esteemed nothing
in the world more sacred than it. They gathered it when the moon was
just six days old because the moon was then thought to be at its greatest
power. This done, they sacrificed two young bullocks which were milk-white.
After that, the mistletoe was cut into small pieces with the aid of
a golden hook or bill and distributed among the people present. These
took it home and suspended it in a prominent place to ward off evil spirits.
From these associations, the mistletoe has become an emblem under which
young people may kiss, without any evil coming to them through their act.</p>

<p><i>HOLLY</i> is used as a Christmas decoration because the Romans chose it to
hang in their houses on the fast in honor of Saturn. Friends gave bunches of it
to those whom they wished to endow with luck and happiness, probably
because the prickly leaves symbolized the crown of thorns worn by Christ
and the red berries the blood of the cross.</p>

<h3>BIRTHDAY FLOWERS</h3>

month of the year. By wearing the blossom named for your month, you may
count on good fortune as the result.</p>

<div class="indent">
<p><i>JANUARY.</i>&mdash;The Snowdrop which is the emblem of purity, hope and
gentleness.</p>

<p><i>FEBRUARY.</i>&mdash;The Violet, the emblem of modesty, kindness and faith.</p>

<p><i>MARCH.</i>&mdash;The Daffodil, the emblem of daintiness, sincerity and graciousness.</p>

<p><i>APRIL.</i>&mdash;The Primrose, the emblem of lovers.</p>

<p><i>MAY.</i>&mdash;The White Lily, the emblem of purity and sweetness.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>SUPERSTITIONS REGARDING ANIMALS</h2>
</div>


<p><i>SERPENTS.</i>&mdash;These creatures have been regarded from very different angles,
according to the time and the country. The story of the serpent in the Garden
of Eden has caused many people to detest them: but numerous are the
references in histories which go to show that serpents and snakes have been
reverenced. In ancient Rome, the serpent was a household god: at other
times, it was regarded as a symbol of life and vitality, and it was frequently
used as a medium for healing the sick. In India, this creature is looked upon
as a mascot for time and wisdom. Thus, it is worn by fanatics as a part of
their headgear, and people make metal replicas and wear them as rings,
bracelets, etc. Clearly, then, serpents have found more favor than disapproval,
and they may be counted as mascots, standing for wisdom, long life and good
health.</p>

<p><i>CATS.</i>&mdash;Cats, the most domestic of animals, are regarded with mixed feelings.
Generally speaking, they are supposed to be unlucky, though oddly
enough a black cat is credited with good qualities when it takes up its abode
in a house. This is due to the fact that, during the Middle Ages, black cats
were supposed to be associated with witches and in league with the evil one.
As a result, people treated them kindly and showered favors on them, not
because they liked them, but because they thought that this treatment would
avert bad luck.</p>

<p>The person who drowns or kills a cat may look for ill-fortune for nine
years. Bad luck attends the vessel or ship on which a cat is found, but on no
account may the creature be thrown overboard after the vessel has sailed.
This would only make matters worse.</p>

<p>If a cat leaves a house, it is supposed to take the luck with it, and leave
nothing but bad fortune behind. If a white cat enters a home, it announces
trouble and sickness. A cat licking itself all over signifies fair weather, but
if it merely washes its face, it means the approach of rain or storms.</p>

<p><i>DOGS.</i>&mdash;A dog howling under a window indicates death.</p>

<div class="poetry-container-left"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent2">Dogs begin in jest and end in earnest.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent2">A dog, a woman, a walnut tree,</div>
      <div class="verse indent4">The more you beat 'em, the better they be.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent2">If a dog bark, go in: if a bitch, go out.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent2">A dog will bark ere he bite.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>HARES.</i>&mdash;If a hare crosses your path, you may look out for a disappointment.
If it runs past houses, there will soon be a fire in one of them.</p>

<p>In the Isle of Man, hares are believed to be the spirits of old women, and
on that account are shunned as articles of food. In other parts, those who
wish to look beautiful for a week make a point of eating hare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p><i>BIRDS.</i>&mdash;Robins are variously regarded in different parts of the country.
Some people think them unlucky, possibly because of their association with
the tragedy of the Babes in the Wood. But generally they are welcomed to
a garden or house, which is supposed to be all the luckier for their coming.
Robins that show signs of being friendly are considered to foretell a hard
winter.</p>

<p>Woodpeckers and kingfishers are also lucky, and any suggestion of ill-luck
is only possible when birds are deliberately killed after having built their nest
and claimed the hospitality of a home.</p>

<p>The screech of a peacock is best unheard when luck is particularly wanted.
The feathers of this bird, known to everyone by reason of their beautiful
coloring, should never be taken indoors, as they are reckoned specially unlucky.</p>

<p>There is an old superstition regarding the cuckoo. Should a maiden, hearing
its notes for the first time that season, kiss her hand to it and say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Cuckoo, cuckoo,</div>
      <div class="verse">Tell me true,</div>
      <div class="verse">When shall I be married?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>she may tell the number of years which will elapse until her wedding by
counting the number of times the bird cries "Cuckoo." She must reckon
each cry as a year.</p>

<p>Another superstition relating to the cuckoo is that what you are doing
when you hear its cries for the first time in any season is what you will spend
most time at during the remainder of the year. Folk in the Channel Islands
claim that they are sure to be fortunate if they jingle their purses and run a
short distance when hearing the cuckoo for the first time in the year.</p>

<p>Owls, crows and magpies do not presage any good: in fact, many people
would rather not meet them when anxiety is at hand. An old jingle says of
magpies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">One for anger,</div>
        <div class="verse indent4">Two for mirth;</div>
      <div class="verse">Three for a wedding</div>
        <div class="verse indent4">Four for a birth.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ravens are supposed to bring luck to the house where they build their nests,
so it is unlucky to kill one.</p>

<p>It is unlucky to touch a yellowhammer in May, since there is the devil's
blood in it then.</p>

<p>For a white pigeon to single out a house and hover round it is a sure sign
of an early marriage or engagement in that house.</p>

<p>A cock crowing during the night-time means a bad illness for someone close
at hand: if it crows during the afternoon, a visitor will arrive.</p>

<p>Sailors are not over-fond of seagulls, believing them to be the spirits of their
dead mates, yet they are most indignant if anyone tries to shoot or kill one
of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p><i>OTHER ANIMALS.</i>&mdash;A cricket singing within a house ensures good luck
for all the household.</p>

<p>Kill a spider and it will surely rain.</p>

<p>See a moth on your clothes and you will get new ones.</p>

<p>A death's head moth indicates bereavement.</p>

<p>Pigs are unlucky creatures when seen singly.</p>

<p>To see a white horse and then, shortly after, a red-haired person, tells of
approaching good fortune.</p>

<p>Moles are unlucky to find alive.</p>

<p>Of bees, the following rhyme is prophetic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">A swarm of bees in May</div>
      <div class="verse">Is worth a load of hay.</div>
      <div class="verse">A swarm of bees in June</div>
      <div class="verse">Is worth a silver spoon.</div>
      <div class="verse">A swarm of bees in July</div>
      <div class="verse">Is not worth a fly.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Country people are still given to treating bees as if they belonged to the
family. For instance, not a few folk tell the bees of the betrothal, marriage
and other outstanding events happening in the home.</p>

<h2>CRYSTAL GAZING</h2>
</div>


<p>Before we start this chapter, will you just take a look at the following short
list of terms used in crystal gazing and spiritualism? You will find that they
will make what follows quite clear, and that they will be useful to refer to.</p>

<p><i>SPIRITUALISTIC.</i>&mdash;Belonging to the spirit world.</p>

<p><i>SECOND SIGHT.</i>&mdash;The power which all have (but few develop). The
power to see the future and other things with the spirit eye.</p>

<p><i>AURA.</i>&mdash;The circle of thought which each one of us is unconsciously sending
out by our characters and personalities.</p>

<p><i>THE CRYSTAL.</i>&mdash;Any object which helps to fix our attention; i.e., a crystal,
a bowl of water, shining metal. There is nothing about the crystal that is

<h3>LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE</h3>

<p>It is believed that this portion of the book will be found particularly
interesting because it is here that we touch upon spiritualism, perhaps one of
the most talked-of subjects of today.</p>

<p>In crystal gazing we actually see many things happen which maybe have
not happened as yet. In palmistry and astrology we see the signs but not the
actual events. Another distinct difference is that in crystal gazing it is
impossible to give definite instructions as to how to receive these messages
or visions because there is no "how."</p>

<p>What we hope to do in this chapter is to show you that perhaps you
possess powers of which you know nothing. Without making the foolish
mistake of taking this subject too seriously, you will be able to interest and
amuse your friends.</p>

<p>You may say, "But I haven't got this power&mdash;I could never see anything
in a crystal."</p>

<p>Don't say that, and don't think it! We all have a little of this power
sleeping within us. If we wish to improve it, we must use and practise it,
but don't overdo the thing.</p>

<p>To understand crystal gazing even a little, it is quite important to know
just a few simple facts about spiritualism (the study of the spirit world.)
This second sight, or clairvoyance (call it what you will) is merely in its
childhood as yet. A very short while ago we should have thought it a miracle
for anyone to speak from New York to London along a wire. Now we
think no more of it than we should of crossing a road!</p>

<p>So with the crystal. At present a few of us only are able to see, more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
less clearly, those visions of the future. Who knows but that in some future
time we shall consider this quite an ordinary and natural thing to do, just like
telephoning, for instance.</p>

<p>The first thing to get hold of is this: we have not one body but two. An
earthly body and its exact copy in a spirit body. By this I do not mean the
soul, but rather our earthly body with all its features just as before, is copied
in a spirit of ether body. This may sound difficult, but just try to grasp the
idea.</p>

<p>In spiritualism there are two of each one of us; one an earthly you, the
other (dwelling usually in your earthly body) a spiritual you. But sometimes
this spirit body escapes from its earthly prison, maybe, during sleep, sometimes
when we look into the crystal, and sometimes in what is called a trance
or artificial sleep. It is then (when the spirit body is free) that visions of
future things are seen, and maybe premonitions (or feelings) of the future
are felt.</p>

<p>Our spirit body, with its ten thousand times more clear-sighted eyes, sees
things which are invisible to the earthly eyes. This body is able to travel
swiftly from place to place, although it always keeps a link or connection
with its earthly double.</p>

<p>When a person goes off into a trance, this is what has happened. The
earthly body sleeps while the spiritual body roams about the future, past and
present, or perhaps visits distant places. It is, of course, able to speak with
other spirit bodies, and thus get information about other folk who have
"passed over," as the spiritualists call death.</p>

<p>Now perhaps you can better appreciate the wonderful stories which you
hear about mediums (people who pass into these trances), who have spoken&mdash;or
are alleged to have spoken, for the verdict of science is "Not proven"&mdash;with
the voices of folk long dead, and whom they have never seen.</p>

<p>While everyone does not actively possess this power of releasing his spirit
body, we all have it. That this is true can be seen in several ways. Have you
never had a presentiment or feeling of evil to come, a strong feeling which
it took all your determination and common sense to drive away? Anyway,
you will have frequently heard other people saying, "I had a feeling that so-and-so
would happen."</p>

<p>That feeling is explained by this wandering of the spirit body; for a short
time we have had our spirit eyes freely opened, and have gained a glimpse
of the unknown. As our spirit eyes are as yet undeveloped it is but a glimpse,
then down falls the thick curtain, and the mystery is once more hidden from
us!</p>

<p>Just as some children learn to walk more easily than others, so do some
people learn to walk with their spirit body and to speak the spirit language
more quickly than others.</p>

<p>Which seems very natural, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Let us briefly refresh our minds with the absolutely necessary facts which
you must know to understand the first steps in fortunetelling by the crystal.
What we are going to say next will then be more readily understood:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p><i>FIRSTLY.</i>&mdash;We have not one body but two, an earthly and a spiritual
body.</p>

<p><i>SECONDLY.</i>&mdash;Though normally contained in the earthly body, it is possible
for the spirit to escape from its prison, and pass from place to place at a
speed greater than light. This occurs during sleep, the artificial or forced
sleep of the trance, and also when one gazes into the crystal.</p>

<p><i>THIRDLY.</i>&mdash;We have four eyes. Two earthly eyes, and two very much
keener spirit eyes. It is with these spirit eyes that we see the future and the
past in the crystal.</p>

<p><i>FOURTHLY.</i>&mdash;Each one of us is sending out thought-waves at this moment.
These are known by spiritualists as our aura. It is found in different
colors, which depend on our characters or the thoughts leaving us. Certain reds
show rage, for instance.</p>


<h3>WHAT THE CRYSTAL IS FOR</h3>

<p>The first thing to get hold of is that there is nothing magic or in any way
wonderful about the crystal itself. It is merely a means of fixing the attention
of our earthly eyes, so that we may see the more clearly with our spirit eyes.</p>

<p>Now for a few hints upon actually looking into the crystal.</p>

<p>When you gaze into whatever object you have chosen, your earthly body
and earthly eyes pass into a more or less sleepy state, thus enabling your spirit
body to escape. That gives us our first point to remember.</p>

<p>Here it is: When you look into the crystal, whatever you do don't worry
about whether or not you will see anything! Try to think steadily of what
you wish to see; this will at first seem hard, but practice will help you, and
practice makes perfect.</p>

<p>Then remember to keep any glare of light from the eyes; it is wise to sit
with one's back towards the light. Let your surroundings be quiet and peaceful;
there must be absolutely nothing which may catch your attention and so
take it off the crystal. If, for instance, a noisy bus or other vehicle were to
pass during the time in which you were making your attempt, it would
probably disturb things very much.</p>

<p>One should never be discouraged if nothing whatever is seen at the first
few attempts. A puppy cannot at first see out of its eyes, and it is the same
with a beginner in crystal gazing; his spirit eyes may take some little time to
open, while others, more fortunate, may find theirs open almost at once.
Never strain the eyes in an unwinking stare. Let them wink and blink quite
naturally. To do anything else would be sure to take your attention from
the picture which you wish to see.</p>


<h3>HOW TO BEGIN</h3>

<p>The best thing to do is to try these various methods, and then see for yourself
which is the most successful in your own individual case.</p>

<p>Here are a few means you might try, in order to test this for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Use either a (1) crystal, (2) a polished object, (3) a bright coin, (4) a
sparkling gem, or (5) ordinary glass in the shape of a sphere or ball. There
are others, but they are not important.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it will be of interest to know just what you may expect to see
when, and if, your spirit eyes open. Probably a misty, fogged appearance will
first be seen in the crystal. This will remain for some little time, until finally
the scene or person (whatever it may be) will appear. The latter may be
faint and dim, or it may be clear-cut like a good photograph.</p>

<p>The clearness or otherwise will depend among other things upon the
keenness of sight of the spirit eye. It will also be influenced by the degree of
quiet, and upon the absence of anything likely to disturb the searcher in the
realms of the future.</p>

<h2>THE MOON AND THE LUCK IT BRINGS</h2>
</div>


<p>People of all ages have looked upon the moon as a provider of good and
bad luck, and most of us have probably noticed that it has influenced our
actions, at times. Here are some of the beliefs that are centuries old.</p>

<p>If you see a new moon over your right shoulder, it means that you will
experience good luck all the month.</p>

<p>If you have money in your pocket and you meet the new moon face to
face, turn the money over and you will not run short of money that month.</p>

<p>It is unlucky to see the new moon through glass. If you do, go out of
doors, curtsey three times to the moon and turn some silver in your hand.
This will break the spell which will be cast over you if you do not do as
directed. There is one little point, connected with this superstition, which
has set us thinking. What of all those individuals who wear glasses? We do
not know the answer.</p>

<p>There is a strongly prevalent idea that everything falling to the lot of man
when the moon is waxing will increase or prosper; but things decrease and
do not prosper when the moon is on the wane.</p>

<p>Irish colleens were wont to drop on their knees when they first caught sight
of the new moon, and say, "Oh, moon, leave us as well as you have found
us." And, long ago, Yorkshire maidens "did worship the new moon on their
bent knees, kneeling upon the earth-cast stone."</p>

<p>If the full moon known as the Harvest Moon appears watery, it is an ill
sign for the harvest. (The Harvest Moon is due about the middle of September.)</p>

<p>If the moon shows a silver shield, be not afraid to reap your field: but if
she rises haloed round, soon we'll tread on deluged ground.</p>

<p>If the moon changes on a Sunday there will be a flood before the month
is out.</p>

<p>A Saturday moon, if it comes once in seven years, comes too soon.</p>

<p>A fog and a small moon bring an easterly wind soon.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">In the waning of the moon,</div>
      <div class="verse">Cloudy morning: fair afternoon.</div>
      <div class="verse">Pale moon doth rain; red moon doth blow,</div>
      <div class="verse">White moon doth neither rain nor snow.</div>
      <div class="verse">When the moon's halo is far, the storm is n'ar (near).</div>
      <div class="verse">When the moon's halo is n'ar, the storm is far.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It has long been a custom for girls to go to the nearest stile, to turn their
back on the first new moon after Midsummer and to chant these verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">All hail, new moon, all hail to thee.</div>
      <div class="verse">I prithee, good moon, reveal to me,</div>
      <div class="verse">This night, who shall my true love be.</div>
      <div class="verse">Who he is and what he wears,</div>
      <div class="verse">And what he does all months and years.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p>If she were to be married in the course of the next twelve months, the
moon answered her questions during her sleep of the same evening.</p>

<p>In many parts of the country it is supposed that, on Christmas Eve, the
moon will help maidens to find out when they are to be married. The plan
is for a maiden to borrow a silk handkerchief from a male relation and to
take it and a mirror to some sheet of water, while the night is dark. She
must go quite alone; but the sheet of water may be an unromantic pail, full
to the brim, stationed at the bottom of the garden. As soon as the moon
shows itself, the maiden places the flimsy piece of silk in front of her eyes, and,
by holding the mirror half towards the moon and half towards the water, it
is possible for her to see more than a pair of reflections. The number of
reflections are the months which will ensue before her wedding bells ring out.</p>

<p>We recently came across the following information in a document quite
three hundred years old:</p>

<p>"The first, second and third days of the moon's age are lucky for buying
and selling; the seventh, ninth and eleventh are lucky for engagements and
marriage; the sixteenth and twenty-first are not lucky for anything."</p>

<p>The same document affirmed that:</p>

<p>"A baby born before the new moon is twenty-four hours old is sure to be
lucky. Anything lost during the second twenty-four hours of the moon's
age is sure to be found. All things begun on the fifth twenty-four hours will
turn out successfully. A dream experienced on the eighth twenty-four hours
must come true."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>FORTUNETELLING BY MEANS OF
PLAYING CARDS</h2>
</div>


<p>Telling fortunes, by means of playing cards, is one of the oldest amusements
indulged in by civilized people. The ancients of the Far East used
their Tarot packs for this purpose long before the birth of Christ, and, ever
since, it has been recognized that cards can be made to give a surprisingly
accurate reading of future events.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that, until modern times, it was a common practice
of men who had to make great and far-reaching decisions for them to consult
a pack of cards and to be guided by what was revealed. Napoleon, it may
be recalled, never made an important move unless the cards advised him to
take the step. Julius Caesar was another great leader who placed his trust
in card readings, and even Shakespeare, the shrewdest of all English writers,
shows by a number of passages in his plays that he recognized the use of cards
for purposes of divination. As for the noted men and women of today, it is
rumored that several derive guidance from their packs when they are in doubt.</p>

<p>Whether the science of cartomancy, the name given to telling fortunes by
the aid of cards, is taken seriously or not, there is no doubt that it will afford
a good deal of merriment when indulged in by a number of pleasure-seeking
friends and relations.</p>

<p>There are few rules governing this science, but those there are must be
strictly observed. First, it is absolutely imperative that the person who is consulting
the cards should set his or her mind on the matter. Thus, when a
definite question is requiring an answer, the question itself must fill the mind.
To let the mind wander to outside things or things that are not involved must
lessen the psychic effect. Next, every consultant must cut the pack with the
left hand, in order to set his or her seal on the order of the cards. Finally, to
obtain the most accurate results, it is necessary that the consultant or person
seeking the information should shuffle the pack.</p>


<h3>THE FOUR-CARD DIVINATION</h3>

<p>This method of fortunetelling is some hundreds of years old and references
to it can be found in the works of people who wrote in Stuart times. After
the consultant has shuffled the pack of fifty-two cards, he or she withdraws
one of them at random and notes the suit. The card is, then, put back in
the pack, which is again shuffled. Next, it is cut with the left hand, as already
suggested.</p>

<p>Now comes the "lay-out." The cards are set face upwards on the table
in four rows, each of thirteen. In doing this, it is imperative that all the rows
should be commenced at the right-hand end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>That done, the key card is sought. In the case of a lady, the key card is the
queen of the suit shown by the card which she picked from the pack at the
outset. When it is a man who is seeking his fortune, the key card is the king
of the suit indicated by the card he picked originally.</p>

<p>Having found the key card in the lay-out, count nine, eighteen, twenty-seven,
thirty-six and forty-five spaces from it, and pick up the cards so placed.
Remember that in counting, a line must be always begun from the right; also
that it may be necessary to revert to the first or subsequent rows in order to
obtain the full set of four cards.</p>

<p>In picking up the four cards, be careful to preserve their order; the first
must be set out first, the second must come second, and the same with the
third and the fourth. Each card stands for some definite portent, and the
four portents supply the reading which affects the consultant.</p>

<p>The portents supplied by each card are as follows:&mdash;</p>


<h4>Hearts</h4>

<p><i>ACE.</i>&mdash;Interests will center more in the home than outside it.</p>

<p><i>KING.</i>&mdash;A person who has the good of others at heart.</p>

<p><i>QUEEN.</i>&mdash;Energy and ability are denoted. There is, however, a strong
tendency towards admiration for many members of the opposite sex.</p>

<p><i>JACK.</i>&mdash;Inclined to be selfish and somewhat averse to following the desires
of others.</p>

<p><i>TEN.</i>&mdash;A happy marriage is indicated.</p>

<p><i>NINE.</i>&mdash;A somewhat restless nature which soon tires and requires a change
of scene.</p>

<p><i>EIGHT.</i>&mdash;This is not a good card for those desiring marriage. If such a
ceremony does occur, it will be late in coming.</p>

<p><i>SEVEN.</i>&mdash;There is evidence that an open-air life is what is required.</p>

<p><i>SIX.</i>&mdash;A happy marriage in the near future is heralded.</p>

<p><i>FIVE.</i>&mdash;Happiness will be provided, but it will not be the result of riches.</p>

<p><i>FOUR.</i>&mdash;Marriage is likely, but the measure of affection resulting from it
appears to be small.</p>

<p><i>THREE.</i>&mdash;Life will entail many reverses, but a broad mind will conquer
them.</p>

<p><i>TWO.</i>&mdash;Marriage will result, but not before many trials have beset the path
to happiness.</p>


<h4>Diamonds</h4>

<p><i>ACE.</i>&mdash;Friendships will spring up where enemies have existed.</p>

<p><i>KING.</i>&mdash;There is a clear indication of social happiness, but the home may be
neglected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p><i>QUEEN.</i>&mdash;This suggests a strong character, but no great amount of affection
is displayed.</p>

<p><i>JACK.</i>&mdash;Amiability is the chief character indicated by this card.</p>

<p><i>TEN.</i>&mdash;There are signs of a large and happy family.</p>

<p><i>NINE.</i>&mdash;There is no need to worry over financial matters; money will flow
in when most required.</p>

<p><i>EIGHT.</i>&mdash;The consultant should keep a firm check on bad habits.</p>

<p><i>SEVEN.</i>&mdash;A very upright and high-minded individual.</p>

<p><i>SIX.</i>&mdash;A person who wavers when a decision has to be made.</p>

<p><i>FIVE.</i>&mdash;A somewhat shallow character is indicated, one who takes insufficient
thought of the morrow.</p>

<p><i>FOUR.</i>&mdash;The consultant displays too little trust in him or herself. An inferiority
complex is possessed.</p>

<p><i>THREE.</i>&mdash;A person of considerable merit, but is shy and retiring.</p>

<p><i>TWO.</i>&mdash;Do not tire of waiting for the good things of life; they will come
without any doubt.</p>


<h4>Clubs</h4>

<p><i>ACE.</i>&mdash;A successful life is ensured in the commercial world for men, and
in the home for women.</p>

<p><i>KING.</i>&mdash;The consultant will succeed in whatever he or she most desires, but
it may entail a tedious wait.</p>

<p><i>QUEEN.</i>&mdash;There are signs that too high a value is placed on the opinions of
others.</p>

<p><i>JACK.</i>&mdash;One who loves recreations and who gives too little attention to the
necessary things in life.</p>

<p><i>TEN.</i>&mdash;Expect many trials unless the other cards point to favorable issues.</p>

<p><i>NINE.</i>&mdash;Money affairs will cause a good deal of anxiety.</p>

<p><i>EIGHT.</i>&mdash;There are definite signs that many so-called friends will only flock
to you when you can be of use to them.</p>

<p><i>SEVEN.</i>&mdash;You will have your share of sorrows.</p>

<p><i>SIX.</i>&mdash;Divide your life into three equal portions. One will be pleasant, one
will be very happy and the other, more or less ordinary. The fates say nothing
of the order in which they will come.</p>

<p><i>FIVE.</i>&mdash;You will have few causes for regrets, if you continue as you are acting
at present.</p>

<p><i>FOUR.</i>&mdash;There are people who are prepared to damage your reputation.
Therefore, be on your guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p><i>THREE.</i>&mdash;If a request is made of you in the near future, be cautious how
you reply. Much will depend on the answer.</p>

<p><i>TWO.</i>&mdash;Beware of coming storms.</p>


<h4>Spades</h4>

<p><i>ACE.</i>&mdash;Much good fortune attends the one who finds this card among the
four that are chosen.</p>

<p><i>KING.</i>&mdash;A card which indicates that the consultant revels in doing kind
actions.</p>

<p><i>QUEEN.</i>&mdash;This indicates that the consultant is, frankly, a flirt.</p>

<p><i>JACK.</i>&mdash;One who tries to make happiness a feature of his or her surroundings.</p>

<p><i>TEN.</i>&mdash;Fix your thoughts on something devoutly wished for and the Fates
will grant it to you.</p>

<p><i>NINE.</i>&mdash;You are given to worrying over things that do not really matter.</p>

<p><i>EIGHT.</i>&mdash;Do not set such store on money. It is not the only thing worth
having.</p>

<p><i>SEVEN.</i>&mdash;Be very careful that you do not marry for anything but love.</p>

<p><i>SIX.</i>&mdash;There is every prospect of a comfortable home, surrounded by children
who bring you happiness.</p>

<p><i>FIVE.</i>&mdash;Happiness will come to you either early in life or very soon.</p>

<p><i>FOUR.</i>&mdash;You do not know how to handle money and you must be careful
that you do not trust it to an unworthy person.</p>

<p><i>THREE.</i>&mdash;You expect too many luxuries. You would be far happier if you
valued the simple things of life.</p>

<p><i>TWO.</i>&mdash;Do not be depressed by troubles. They will pass away.</p>

<p>Now that the meaning of all the fifty-two cards is known, one thing more
requires to be explained. Let us suppose that the four cards have been drawn
from the lay-out, as already directed. It may happen that one of them directly
contradicts another card. What happens then? In such a case, the second
card to be drawn from the lay-out has the effect of cancelling the first, but
the force of the second card is weakened thereby and its portent is lessened.
It is because of this that it is highly necessary to remember the order in which
the four cards are taken from the lay-out.</p>


<h3>THE THREE-CARD DIVINATION</h3>

<p>In this case, the first thing is to run through an ordinary pack and separate
the court from the non-picture cards. The latter are then shuffled by the
person seeking information, who finally cuts them with the left hand. That
done, the matching card is sought. The matching card, it must be explained,
is a card which matches the consultant. Thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>(a) A lady with brown hair is matched by the Queen of Clubs. A gentleman,
by the King of Clubs.</p>

<p>(b) A lady who is blonde, is matched by the Queen of Hearts. A gentleman
by the King of Hearts.</p>

<p>(c) A lady with auburn hair is matched by the Queen of Diamonds. A
gentleman, by the King of Diamonds.</p>

<p>(d) A lady with black hair is matched by the Queen of Spades. A
gentleman, by the King of Spades.</p>

<p>(e) Grey or white hair is matched according to its original color.</p>

<p>As soon as the matching card is decided on, the consultant shuts his or
her eyes, and, with the left hand, picks up a portion of the non-picture card
pack. With the right hand, he or she places the matching card on the rest
of the pack and the whole is reformed.</p>

<p>Thus, the pack now consists of forty-one cards, forty of them being numeral
cards and the remaining one, a picture card. On no account may there be any
shuffling at this point.</p>

<p>All is ready. The cards are turned over one at a time, no notice being
taken of them until the matching card is reached. Then, the next three cards
of the same suit as the matching card are withdrawn from the pack and set
out on the table, in the order in which they were found. These three cards
provide the reading sought by the consultant.</p>

<p>The interpretations are as follows:</p>

<p><i>ACE.</i>&mdash;You will be lucky in love affairs, if you have not already been so.
You will make your partner very happy and your home will be your greatest
pride.</p>

<p><i>TWO.</i>&mdash;You are inclined to take life too easily and you are not very keen on
hard work.</p>

<p><i>THREE.</i>&mdash;You are a rover and are liable to be very unsettled at times. Remember
the old saying that a rolling stone gathers no moss.</p>

<p><i>FOUR.</i>&mdash;You will experience four sorrows in your life that you will never
forget.</p>

<p><i>FIVE.</i>&mdash;There is not the slightest doubt that you will accumulate wealth.
Probably, some of it will come as a legacy.</p>

<p><i>SIX.</i>&mdash;You will gather many friends around you. All of them will not be
of equal worth.</p>

<p><i>SEVEN.</i>&mdash;Your health will be one of your strongest points, unless you
neglect it, when it will be sure to rebel.</p>

<p><i>EIGHT.</i>&mdash;You are a fortunate person, and there will be more than one occasion
in your life when you will experience a very lucky escape.</p>

<p><i>NINE.</i>&mdash;Do not expect to gain riches by means of games of chance, lotteries,
etc. Your fortunes will not be increased by them.</p>

<p><i>TEN.</i>&mdash;You have the habit of looking on the bright side of things. This is
a quality worth more than all the gold in the world. Cherish it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE MAGIC SQUARE</h3>

<p>This is a very old way of divining what the Fates have planned for yourself,
your friends and your enemies. The first thing is to take out of the pack
all the court cards, as well as the twos, threes, fours, fives and sixes. Thus,
all that is left are the cards ranging between the sevens and the tens&mdash;sixteen
in all.</p>

<p>The second thing is to take your matching card, as described under the
previous heading, and to place it with the sixteen cards. These are, then, well
shuffled and cut with your left hand.</p>

<p>The next step is to turn over the cards from the pack, one by one, preserving
the order carefully, until the matching card is reached. When this is found,
the cards that have been turned over are placed at the bottom of the stack
that is left in hand and the "lay-out" is commenced.</p>

<div class="figcenter bigfig">
<img src="images/i_118.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 23.&mdash;The Magic Square, showing the order in which the cards are to be set out.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first card in hand is placed on the table and the eight that follow are
arranged around it to form a square. This square will thus consist of three
rows, each made up of three cards, with the matching card in the center.</p>

<p>It is very important that the eight cards are placed in definite positions, as
follows: The first is set down to the right of the matching card; the second
to the left of it; the third immediately above it; the fourth just below it; the
four remaining cards are placed in the upper left-hand corner of the square,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the upper right-hand corner, the lower right-hand corner and the lower left-hand
corner, respectively. (See the diagram.)</p>

<p>All these cards are read in the following manner: The three above the
matching card refer to the past; the card on either side of it to the present;
and the three below it to the future. Next, the three cards on the left-hand
side of the matching card refer to your friends; the card above and below
the matching card refers to yourself; and those on the right of it to your
enemies.</p>

<p>Following this, you must note that a heart stands for very fortunate things,
a club for good things, a diamond for things that are passable, and spades for
things that are no good at all.</p>

<p>Thus, should a heart come in the middle of the bottom row it shows that
you are to be very fortunate in the future; if a diamond fills the same position
in the upper row, it is clear that your past was only passably happy; and if a
spade comes immediately on the right of the matching card, it is a clear proof
that the particular enemy you have in mind is being harassed by a period of
ill-luck. And so on, according to which suit fills each of the remaining positions.</p>


<h3>THE FORTUNETELLING PYRAMID</h3>

<p>A simple way of discovering what kind of luck is awaiting you in the future
consists in taking a complete pack of fifty-two cards, shuffling them well, and
cutting them with the left hand.</p>

<p>Following this, you place one card on the table, face up. Below it you set
out two cards, also face up, and continue with a row of three cards below the
two. Other rows follow with four, five, six, seven, eight and nine cards in
each, so that the whole forms a pyramid. This accounts for forty-five cards.
The surplus of seven are placed on one side when the figure is completed or
they may be thrown aside, one at a time, while the figure is being made at
any point desired, but it is important that they must be rejected before being
seen.</p>

<p>To estimate the amount of luck or good fortune that awaits your future,
pick up the last card that was laid down in each row. Naturally, there will
now be no card left in the first row, one in the second, two in the third row,
and so on until the ninth row will consist of eight cards only. Take the nine
cards picked up and sort them into suits. If there are most hearts, you are
to be a very lucky person; if there are most clubs, you are to be just lucky; if
there are most diamonds you will be passably lucky; but luck will not come
your way at all if spades are in the majority.</p>

<p>Should two suits tie for first place the Fates require you to make the
pyramid over again.</p>


<h3>SEVENS AND THREES</h3>

<p>The following method of consulting one's luck must have been attempted
many millions of times, but it is not known so well now as it was a century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
ago. The first thing is to shuffle a full pack thoroughly. This, of course,
must be done by the person whose luck is being tested. And then, it is necessary
that he or she cuts with the left hand.</p>

<p>After these preliminaries, someone takes the pack and deals the cards one at
a time, face downwards, on to the table, placing them in a heap. The consultant
who is seeking to find out what the Fates are determining should really
be blindfolded, but this is unnecessary if the cards are new and cannot be
recognized by any markings on the backs.</p>

<p>The consultant has to choose any three cards as they are being slowly dealt.
They can be three cards coming together, or widely separated, or just as he
or she fancies.</p>

<p>As each card is selected, it is set aside and, when the three are chosen, not
before, they are turned face up and arranged in the order of selection. Each
card from one to nine stands for its own value, but tens and all court cards
stand for nought. Thus, if the three cards are a seven, a ten and a five, the
mystic number derived from them is 705.</p>

<p>The final step is to find out if the mystic number is divisible either by seven
or by three. If the total is divisible by either of these numbers, then there is
good luck awaiting the consultant; if the total is divisible by both seven and
three, the luck is doubled. On the other hand, should there be a remainder
when dividing, bad luck is not claimed.</p>


<h3>YOUR LUCK IN THE COMING WEEK</h3>

<p>A hundred years ago, this method of reading what the Fates were likely to
provide for us in the coming week was resorted to in almost every house
where a pack of cards existed.</p>

<p>The first step is to pick out your matching card from the pack, as explained
under the heading "The Three-Card Divination." This card is set out on the
table, face up. Then you shuffle the remainder of the pack and cut it with
your left hand. That done, you form a ring round the matching card, using
the first seven cards from the pack for the purpose. All the cards in the ring
should be face down and none should overlap.</p>

<p>The next thing is to discard the three top cards from what remains of the
pack and then to take the third, sixth, ninth, twelfth, fifteenth, eighteenth
and twenty-first cards, placing them one each on the seven cards already set
out in a circle. These cards must not be looked at while this is being done,
and they may be set on the original seven in any order thought fit. But this
should be noted, whichever card is paired first must be taken to represent the
coming Sunday and the other days follow in a clockwise arrangement.</p>

<p>Thus, the arrangement now consists of a circle, formed of seven heaps each
consisting of two cards. Read them thus:</p>

<div class="indent">
    <p>
    (a)  Two hearts in the same heap represent a day of exceedingly good<br />
    fortune.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
    (b)  One heart and one club, a day of very good fortune.</p>
    <p>(c)  One heart and one diamond, a day of good fortune.</p>
    <p>(d)  One heart and one spade, a day of moderate fortunes.</p>
    <p>(e)  Two clubs, a day as (c).</p>
    <p>(f)  One club and one diamond, a day as (d).</p>
    <p>(g)  One club and one spade, a day of fair luck.</p>
    <p>(h)  Two diamonds, a day neither lucky nor unlucky.</p>
    <p>(i)  One diamond and one spade, a day much as (h).</p>
    <p>(j)  Two spades, a day of no luck.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>ARE YOU TO BE LUCKY?</h3>

<p>Ever since the pack of cards has been constituted as it is now, it has been
considered that the four suits have a definite value as far as luck and fortune
are concerned. This is a fact that most people probably know, but for the
benefit of those who are unaware of it, we will point out that hearts stand for
more luck than all the others, that clubs are the next in point of favor, that
diamonds come third, and that spades bring no luck at all.</p>

<p>These values are used in the following method of finding out whether you
may consider yourself as lucky or not. The full pack is taken and, from it,
all the twos, threes, fours, fives and sixes are extracted. These cards are put
on one side, as they are not used, and the remainder is shuffled.</p>

<p>The next thing is for you to cut the short pack with the left hand and then
to deal it into four equal stacks. Each stack is given one card at a time;
that is to say, the eight cards of one stack are not allotted all at once.</p>

<p>This done, you take the third heap, without looking at the other three, and
turn up the cards. Most likely all the suits will be represented and the thing
is to note how many cards there are of each. If there are most of hearts, your
good luck is assured; if clubs predominate, then you are still fortunate; if
diamonds head the list, you will have average luck; but when spades are in
the majority, your best plan is to tell yourself that there is no such thing as
good and bad luck.</p>

<p>One thing more about the reckoning. If, say, hearts occur only four times
in the heap, and no other suit is present as often, then, as we say, good luck
is yours. But, should hearts occur five, six, seven or eight times, then your
good luck is correspondingly increased in amount. The same rule should be
applied to the other suits.</p>


<h3>PEERING INTO THE FUTURE</h3>

<p>You probably have some question that you would like answered. It may
concern&mdash;well, it can concern anything you like and you need confide to
nobody what it is about. This is a method of obtaining the answer to such
a question:</p>

<p>If you are of the female sex, take the four queens from a pack and, if you
are a male, take the four kings. Place them face down on the table in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of you and, with your eyes shut, shuffle them round and round, using only
your left hand. Work the cards round in the opposite direction to the movement
of the hands of a clock. When you have lost all idea of the identity
of the cards, still with your left hand and with your eyes tightly shut, place
the cards in a line in front of you. Now, open your eyes and turn the cards
face up.</p>

<p>The card to the left of the line stands for "This year"; the card filling the
second position stands for "Next year"; the card coming third, for "Sometime";
and the card at the right of the line, for "Never." The card that is a
heart answers the question and the others are ignored. Thus, if the heart
fills the second position, the answer is "Next year"; if it comes fourth, the
answer is "Never."</p>

<p>It is claimed by astrologers that a true answer to the question is only obtained
on the first occasion that this method is employed after a new moon
has appeared.</p>


<h3>WHAT REVERSED CARDS REVEAL</h3>

<p>In most cases, the cards of an ordinary pack look the same whether viewed
one way or the other; in other words, if they were cut in halves across the
shortest dimension, each half would be exactly alike. But this is not so in
every case. Take, for instance, the aces of hearts, clubs and spades; with
these the tops and bottoms would be different, though with the ace of
diamonds, they would be the same. All the sevens offer further cases where
the two halves are not identical and the same may be said of some of the
eights. In addition, it must be pointed out that all packs do not follow the
same arrangement, so that a list of these unbalanced cards cannot be given.</p>

<p>Astrologists have long considered that these cards, which are not alike top
and bottom, possess certain powers in deciding one's luck. This is how
they act:</p>

<p>Take a full pack and shuffle it thoroughly, then cut with the left hand.
After that, turn each card over, one by one, and it is advisable to work slowly,
as mistakes are easily made.</p>

<p>Look at every card in turn, count the pips on it that are the right way up
and those that are upside down. When the latter are more in number than
the former, you have a reversed card. Set it aside and continue with the cards
that follow. Note that it is not any card that permits of being reversed, but
only those that are actually reversed, that should be set aside. Note, also,
that a reversed card to you is not reversed to someone sitting opposite you.</p>

<p>When the pack has been run through and all the reversed cards taken out,
note what you have found. Count up the number belonging to each suit.
If hearts are in the majority, you are indeed lucky; if spades figure most, you
are the reverse. Clubs are not quite so lucky as hearts and diamonds rank a
little below clubs.</p>

<p>Should any suit figure much more than the others, then the above readings
are strengthened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>


<h3>CARD COMBINATIONS</h3>

<p>This method of discovering certain facts about your future is as old as the
hills, if not older. It depends on laying out the cards and noting how certain
of them are arranged.</p>

<p>The first thing you do is to take an ordinary pack and remove from it all
the twos, threes, fours, fives and sixes. This will leave you with thirty-two
cards in hand. Next, you shuffle very thoroughly and cut with the left hand.
That done, you set out the thirty-two cards in four rows, each of eight cards.
Be careful to commence each row at the right and then work to the left. Of
course, you must put them out in exactly the same order as they come off
the pack.</p>

<p>The "lay-out" being completed, you carefully look at the cards. You look,
first, to see if by any chance there are four aces touching anywhere. If so, the
scrutiny ceases and you find out, from the list given below, what the meaning
is of four aces touching. But if there are not four such aces, then you search
for four kings and, failing them, four queens, and so on, down to four sevens.
If all these fail, you look for three cards of a kind starting as before with aces
and working down to sevens. Should there be no groups of threes, then you
look for groups of two. Of course, after that there is no point in continuing
the scrutiny if there are no twos.</p>

<p>Be careful to understand that the cards forming a group need not all occur
in the same horizontal line. As long as one card touches another of the same
value, whether at the top, bottom, sides or even at the corners, it will count.
Note also that the only reading that may be taken from a "lay-out" is the
highest reading. Thus, if there are four aces and three queens, you are not
permitted to take the reading of the queens, if you prefer it, to that of the
aces. The reading of the aces alone counts.</p>

<p>These are the readings:&mdash;</p>


<h4>Fours</h4>

<p><i>FOUR ACES.</i>&mdash;Dangers may attack you while you are least expecting them.</p>

<p><i>FOUR KINGS.</i>&mdash;You are likely to rise in the world and be endowed with
fame.</p>

<p><i>FOUR QUEENS.</i>&mdash;You will be led into quarrels, not of your own seeking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p><i>FOUR EIGHTS.</i>&mdash;You are likely to form some great desire, and that desire
will be attained, if you are true to yourself.</p>

<p><i>FOUR SEVENS.</i>&mdash;There is a very happy home marked out for you, if you
wish it.</p>


<h4>Threes</h4>

<p><i>THREE ACES.</i>&mdash;Good news is coming.</p>

<p><i>THREE KINGS.</i>&mdash;Some great desire that you have is about to be realized.

<p><i>THREE TENS.</i>&mdash;Wait patiently and a very happy time will not be long
in coming.</p>

<p><i>THREE NINES.</i>&mdash;Your wishes may not come true as soon as you would

<p><i>THREE EIGHTS.</i>&mdash;Marriage is imminent for those of single blessedness
who have set their hearts on it.</p>

<p><i>THREE SEVENS.</i>&mdash;First, there is a cloud and behind it is bright sunshine.
This applies to you.</p>

<p><i>TWO ACES.</i>&mdash;You are about to start on some new enterprise and make
a success of it.</p>

<p><i>TWO KINGS.</i>&mdash;You are shortly meeting a stranger who will mean a good
deal to you.</p>

<p><i>TWO QUEENS.</i>&mdash;Doubt is to cloud your mind. You will seek advice
from a certain quarter. Take the advice and do not lose sight of the giver.</p>

<p><i>TWO JACKS.</i>&mdash;Your faith is to be sorely tried. See that you do not injure
your reputation.</p>

<p><i>TWO TENS.</i>&mdash;There is every sign of good fortune in the future.</p>

<p><i>TWO NINES.</i>&mdash;There is a great surprise in store for you.</p>

<p><i>TWO EIGHTS.</i>&mdash;Be judicious in your dealings with the opposite sex.</p>

<p><i>TWO SEVENS.</i>&mdash;The unengaged are soon to be engaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>


<h4>Other Combination of Cards</h4>

<p>Should the cards offer none of the above arrangements, the following may
be found, but they are meaningless unless all the foregoing have failed.</p>

<p><i>KING OF CLUBS AND TEN OF HEARTS.</i>&mdash;Love is coming.</p>

<p><i>KING OF DIAMONDS AND TEN OF SPADES.</i>&mdash;Beware of lovers'
quarrels.</p>

<p><i>KING AND QUEEN OF SAME SUIT.</i>&mdash;A proposal or its equivalent.</p>

<p><i>QUEEN OF SPADES AND ANY JACK.</i>&mdash;Take care of the wiles of a
woman well known to you.</p>

<p><i>TEN OF HEARTS AND NINE OF CLUBS.</i>&mdash;A journey is awaiting you.</p>

<p><i>TEN OF HEARTS AND ACE OF SPADES.</i>&mdash;A birth.</p>

<p><i>NINE OF HEARTS AND ACE OF CLUBS.</i>&mdash;Your wishes will be fulfilled.</p>

<p><i>SEVEN OF HEARTS AND SEVEN OF CLUBS.</i>&mdash;Your troubles are
about to end.</p>


<h3>ZODIAC CARD READING</h3>

<p>Perhaps you do not know which is your lucky month. If you would like
to find out, the following simple method is helpful.</p>

<p>Take one or two packs of cards, according to the instructions below. Bridge
cards are preferable as they are small. Then, cut twelve pieces of paper, each
the size of one of the cards. On each piece, draw a sign of the Zodiac and
arrange the pieces on the table, as shown in the diagram. It will be seen
that the signs are placed in their monthly order from April to March and
not from January to December. This order must be followed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_125.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 24.&mdash;The Arrangement of the Signs for Zodiacal Card Reading.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Next, find out your lucky number, as directed in the chapter "What is your
Lucky Number?" For such numbers from one to four, one complete pack
is needed; for numbers from five to eight, two packs are necessary. When
nine is the lucky number, either use three packs or take two packs and
shuffle in with the cards four pieces of paper, each the same size as a card,
and on each write a heart, a club, a diamond or a spade.</p>

<p>Shuffle the cards thoroughly and then deal them out, giving each sign
of the Zodiac a card in turn. Lay on each sign as many cards as indicated
by your lucky number, then stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Look at the cards lying on each sign. Wherever you find more hearts
than any other suit on a sign, take it as a portent that the month indicated
by the sign is a lucky one for you. Of course, it is quite possible and even
desirable that you may have more than one fortunate month.</p>


<h3>A BIRTHDAY MESSAGE FROM THE CARDS</h3>

<p>We have seen this fortunetelling game played at many parties and other
gatherings, and it has always caused a good deal of innocent amusement.</p>

<p>First of all, an ordinary pack is taken and the court cards are withdrawn
from it. They alone are used, while the numeral cards are put on one side.
These court cards are shuffled and the players sit around the table.</p>

<p>One of the players is appointed as the seer. He or she takes the twelve
cards, spreads them out in a fan, face down, and the first player selects one.
When this card is withdrawn from the fan, it is turned up. While everybody
looks at the chosen card, the seer asks the player the date of his or her
birth. On hearing the date, the seer notes whether it comes under the heading,
spring, summer, autumn or winter. Then he reckons:</p>

<div class="indent">
    <p>(a) Any date in March, April or May as spring.</p>

    <p>(b) Any in June, July or August as summer.</p>

    <p>(c) Any in September, October or November as autumn.</p>

    <p>(d) Any in December, January or February as winter.</p>
</div>

<p>Next, he looks down the appropriate section, given below, and reads out
the message, according to the card which the player has withdrawn from the
fan.</p>

<p>That completes the business for the first player and the performance is
gone through afresh, in exactly the same way, for the second and all subsequent
people taking part in the game.</p>

<p>Here are the messages provided by each card:</p>


<h4>Spring</h4>

<p><i>KING OF HEARTS.</i>&mdash;Kindness to an elderly person will result in financial
gain to you.</p>

<p><i>KING OF CLUBS.</i>&mdash;You will have a love letter that will cause you some

which will please you.</p>

<p><i>KING OF CLUBS.</i>&mdash;Show your love and your love will be returned.</p>

<p><i>QUEEN OF CLUBS.</i>&mdash;A stranger will assist you to good fortune.</p>

hurry to accept the invitation.</p>

<p><i>QUEEN OF DIAMONDS.</i>&mdash;You will find happiness most where money
abounds.</p>

<p><i>JACK OF DIAMONDS.</i>&mdash;You have remarkable powers which you are
not fully using.</p>

<p><i>KING OF CLUBS.</i>&mdash;Don't let money stand in the way of your marriage.</p>

<p><i>QUEEN OF CLUBS.</i>&mdash;Do not be surprised if an enemy relents and becomes
a friend.</p>

<p><i>JACK OF CLUBS.</i>&mdash;Try to forget your disappointment. Happiness is due
from quite another quarter.</p>

<p><i>KING OF DIAMONDS.</i>&mdash;Relatives are rising against you. Act fearlessly
and they will recognize your sterling qualities.</p>

<p><i>QUEEN OF DIAMONDS.</i>&mdash;You are marked out by the Fates to be the
recipient of some very good fortune.</p>

<p><i>JACK OF DIAMONDS.</i>&mdash;Within seventeen days or weeks, a startling
offer is to be made to you.</p>

<p><i>KING OF SPADES.</i>&mdash;Make a wish within the next hour and it shall be
fulfilled within the next year.</p>

<p><i>QUEEN OF SPADES.</i>&mdash;Avoid the one with the dark complexion.</p>

<p><i>JACK OF SPADES.</i>&mdash;A late marriage will be more prosperous than an
early one.</p>

<h3>THE WISH CARD</h3>

<p>The nine of hearts has long been regarded as the wish card; that is to say,
if a player wins this card, in any agreed manner, he or she will have a wish
fulfilled.</p>

<p>The most usual way to decide who is to be the lucky individual is for the
players to sit around the table and for each to write down a wish on a
slip of paper, and then to initial it. That done, the papers are collected and
set aside to await the decision of the cards.</p>

<p>The cards are dealt to the players in turn in the ordinary manner from a
full pack. Just how many each person is to receive depends on the number
of players, but all must have the same number, and each should be given as
many as the pack allows. Thus, there will often be a few cards left over.
These are set in the middle of the table and not used.</p>

<p>When play starts, somebody begins by turning over the first card on his or
her pack. If this is a numeral card, the next person follows by turning over
the first card on his or her pack, and so the play continues round the table.
But, if someone turns over a jack, the next person must pay that person one
card, i.e., the card coming first on his pack. If a queen is turned over, the
payment is the next two cards; if it is a king, the next three cards, while an
ace requires the payment of the four next cards. The person playing the jack,
queen, king or ace takes not only the cards paid but any that may be lying
face upwards in front of the person paying. All paid cards are placed at the
bottom of the receiver's pack.</p>

<p>There is one point more to note; if, while in the act of paying, the payer
turns over a jack, queen, king or ace his debt is cancelled, the previous player
gets nothing and the next player has to enter upon the business of paying.</p>

<p>As soon as one player has lost all his or her cards, the game stops and
everybody glances through his or her pack to see who possesses the wish card,
the nine of hearts. The lucky individual is then given the slip of paper on
which his wish is written and must read it out loud. Not until it has been
announced to all the company will the Fates take any consideration of it.</p>


<h3>OLD MAID</h3>

<p>The game known as "Old Maid" is a favorite that will continue to be
played as long as cards exist. How it is played is within the knowledge of
everybody, but the following variation is not so well-known, and it is certainly
more exciting.</p>

<p>Instead of taking out of the pack any of the queens, in this variation the
Queen of Clubs is removed. Then, the passing on of cards from one player
to another and the pairing, whenever possible, proceeds in the usual way.
But a red queen can only be paired with the other red queen, which makes
the Queen of Spades a troublesome card.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Whoever is left with it at the end of the game is a very unfortunate old
maid, since spades are the most unlucky cards of the whole pack.</p>


<h3>THE LAST CARD</h3>

<p>Have you some question that you want answered? It may be a question
to do with love, marriage, health, finances, or almost anything. Here is a
way to find the answer.</p>

<div class="figcenter bigfig">
<img src="images/i_130.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 25.&mdash;The Last Card.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>From a pack of playing cards, take out the four aces, the four twos, the
four threes and the four queens&mdash;sixteen cards in all. Note that men use the
four kings instead of the queens.</p>

<p>Shuffle the sixteen cards and then spread them out on the table, face down.
They should lie on the table in a mixed-up heap and not in an orderly pack.</p>

<p>To start, pick any card from the heap, turn it over, and then, according
to its value, place it in its proper position, as indicated by the formation shown
in the diagram. Suppose, for instance, that it is a two of hearts; then it fills the
space of the bottom left-hand corner; or if it is the queen of diamonds, it
goes in the second space of the third row.</p>

<p>When the first card is placed, pick at random a second card and put it in
the position indicated for it in the diagram. Follow in the same way with
all the other cards, from three to fifteen, but not with the sixteenth. This
is the card which supplies your answer. If it is the queen (or king) of hearts,
your answer will be "Certainly yes"; if it is the two of spades, it is "Certainly
not." The other cards come between these two and supply answers varying
from "yes" to "no." Their actual meanings are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="indent">
    <p>1.&mdash;<i>QUEEN OF HEARTS.</i>&mdash;Certainly yes.</p>

    <p>2.&mdash;<i>ACE OF HEARTS.</i>&mdash;Yes.</p>

    <p>3.&mdash;<i>THREE OF HEARTS.</i>&mdash;Probably yes.</p>

    <p>4.&mdash;<i>TWO OF HEARTS.</i>&mdash;A likelihood of yes.</p>

    <p>5.&mdash;<i>QUEEN OF CLUBS.</i>&mdash;It may be yes.</p>

    <p>6.&mdash;<i>ACE OF CLUBS.</i>&mdash;It is hopeful.</p>

    <p>7.&mdash;<i>THREE OF CLUBS.</i>&mdash;If you are lucky, it will be yes.</p>

    <p>8.&mdash;<i>TWO OF CLUBS.</i>&mdash;It is fifty-fifty.</p>

    <p>9.&mdash;<i>QUEEN OF DIAMONDS.</i>&mdash;The chances are equal.</p>

    <p>10.&mdash;<i>ACE OF DIAMONDS.</i>&mdash;If you are unlucky, it will be no.</p>

    <p>11.&mdash;<i>THREE OF DIAMONDS.</i>&mdash;It is not hopeful.</p>

    <p>12.&mdash;<i>TWO OF DIAMONDS.</i>&mdash;It may be no.</p>

    <p>13.&mdash;<i>QUEEN OF SPADES.</i>&mdash;There is a likelihood of no.</p>

    <p>14.&mdash;<i>ACE OF SPADES.</i>&mdash;Probably no.</p>

    <p>15.&mdash;<i>THREE OF SPADES.</i>&mdash;No.</p>

    <p>16.&mdash;<i>TWO OF SPADES.</i>&mdash;Certainly no.</p>
</div>

<p>Be very careful to decide the question before the cards are touched.</p>

<h3>MADAME LENORMAND'S METHOD</h3>

<p>Madame Lenormand, one of the most celebrated fortunetellers who has ever
lived, had a method of divining people's futures by means of cards which
we describe here.</p>

<div class="figcenter bigfig">
<img src="images/i_132.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 26.&mdash;Madame Lenormand's "Lay-Out."</p></div>
</div>

<p>First, she decided on her client's matching card, in the way explained
elsewhere in this chapter, and placed it on the table in the position marked
1, in the diagram.</p>

<p>Next, she took the four aces, twos, threes, fours, fives and sixes from a
pack, giving twenty-four cards, and allowed her client to shuffle them, which
was followed by the same person cutting them with the left hand.</p>

<p>Then Madame took the cards and arranged them around the matching
card in the order shown in the diagram. The layout completed, she looked at
the various cards and gathered information from their positions.</p>

<p>It would be impossible for any ordinary person to derive as much information
from them as she did, but we can follow the chief lines of her
thoughts.</p>

<p>This is how she reasoned:</p>

<p>My client assumes the central position, and around her are positions 2,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Now what cards fill these stations? If there is an
abundance of hearts, then friends surround her; if there is an abundance of
spades, then enemies encompass her. If there are clubs or diamonds, then
just ordinary people are flocking to her side.</p>

<p>It will be seen that Madame gave little consideration to the clubs or diamonds,
though she naturally preferred the former, and made her calculations
largely on the positions of the hearts and spades. Broadly speaking, the nearer
the hearts pressed around the matching card, the better were the fortunes of her
client, the farther away were the hearts, the worse were the client's fortunes.</p>

<p>Then, she considered an ace to have a stronger force than a two, and a
two a stronger force than a three, and the six weakest of all. Thus an ace
of hearts could more than neutralize the evil influences of a six of spades;
but an ace of spades would be more than a match for the six of hearts.</p>

<p>We advise you to follow Madame Lenormand's method and see how
the cards dispose themselves in your favor.</p>


<h3>PATIENCE LUCK</h3>

<p>Many people who play games of patience a good deal are convinced that,
if they are able to bring three different forms of patience to a successful
conclusion on the same day, they only have to wish for something and the
wish will be granted to them.</p>

<p>The particular games they play are known as "Tens," "Demon" and "the
Idiot's Delight."</p>

<p>It must be understood that there is no necessity to be successful on the
first trial of each of the games. Such a thing is almost impossible. What
these devotees do is to go on playing until they bring out, say, the "Tens," and
then they turn to either of the other two and work at it. Should they be so
lucky as to get out all the three, then they formulate their wish and wait for
it to come true.</p>

<p>In case some readers do not know how to play these fascinating games, we
will proceed to explain them.</p>

<p><i>TENS.</i>&mdash;For this, two full packs are required. The cards are well shuffled
and then a row of ten cards is dealt out on the table, face down. This done,
another row of ten cards is laid out, also face down. Next, a third row is
set out, but this time the cards are placed face up.</p>

<p>The player looks at the ten face cards and throws out any aces. Then he
builds up suits, as far as he can, by resting a card of opposite color, and of one
degree lower in value, on some other card. Thus, a red goes on a black, a
black on a red, a queen on a king, a two on a three, and so on. When the
shifting of cards causes a file to have no face card in it, then the uppermost
non-face card may be turned over, ready for being used.</p>

<p>As soon as all the possible movements have been effected, a fresh set of
ten cards is dealt out, one being placed on each file. The movements are recommenced.
Note that not only can one suitable card be placed on another,
but partial runs of cards may be so moved, as long as there is no broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
sequence in them. Thus, a black two, a red three, a black four and a red five
may be lifted in one operation on to a black six; but a red three, a black four,
a black five may not be put on a red six. It is possible, however, to lift the red
three and black four on to a red five, if such a card is available.</p>

<p>Should a file become quite empty, with not even face-down cards in it, then
it is possible to fill it with a king and any proper following sequence, should
such a one be within reach in any other file. The use of this movement
becomes apparent after a few games have been played.</p>

<p>When the second lot of ten face cards has been dealt with, a third ten
is set out, and other lots of ten are dealt in the same way, until the double
pack, in hand, is exhausted.</p>

<p>The aim of the game is to have no cards left in the lay-out, and this is
obtained by building up sequences from "king" to "two" and, as soon as one
of these complete sequences is formed, it is removed from the game.</p>

<p>If, when all the two packs have been dealt out and all the possible movements
of cards made, there are broken sequences left, then the game has
failed and it is finished.</p>

<p>In order to make the explanation absolutely clear, a diagram is given on
this and the opposite page. It shows how the cards should be set on the table
before any play is commenced. Naturally, the choice of the face cards is
arbitrary. This is how the movements will be made:</p>

<p>First, the ace of hearts is thrown aside and the card behind it is turned up.
Then, the six of clubs (black) is placed on the seven of diamonds (red) and
the five of hearts (red) is put on the six of clubs. The card immediately
behind the six and, also, the one behind the five are turned face up. Next,
the three of diamonds (red) is put on the four of clubs (black), and the card
behind the three is turned up. But the four and the three can go on the five
of hearts. So the card below the four is turned. In addition, the cards
turned up by the movements of those mentioned may help to continue
the sequences.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>No. 28.&mdash;See Opposite.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>DEMON.</i>&mdash;For this game, one pack of cards is required. After it has
been thoroughly shuffled, four cards are placed in line, face up, and then
thirteen cards are dealt, face down, in a stack. Some people call this stack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the rubbish heap. Next, one card is turned up: it is known as the formation
card.</p>

<p>Before any more is done, the four cards placed in line are examined. Should
one of them be of the opposite color to another, and of one degree lower in
value, it is put on the higher card. Thus, a red ten goes on a black jack and
a black queen on a red king, and so on. If at this point, or at any subsequent
time in the game, one of the four files, originally formed by the four
cards first set down, becomes vacant, then it is filled by taking a card from
the rubbish heap.</p>

<p>Now, let us think of the formation card. Naturally, there are three more
of the same value in the pack. Whenever any of these three are discovered,
they are placed beside the original formation card. The game is to get out
the four formation cards and to build up on them in their proper sequence and
in the same suit. Any card uncovered in the play, in building up the alternate
sequences on the original files, or turned up from the rubbish heap, may be
used for the purpose.</p>

<p>When the lay-out has been arranged, the cards in hand are turned over
in threes and used for file sequences or formation building. On reaching
the end of the pack in hand, it is picked up and turned over in threes again.
And this is continued as often as any cards may be used from the pack. When
no more cards can be used, there is no point in turning over the threes any
more and the game ceases. If the four formation cards have been found and
built up with the twelve subsequent cards following them, the game has been
successful; but when this is impossible the game has failed.</p>

<p>Note that in a case where the formation card is, say, a six, it is built upon
in the following order: seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king, ace, two,
three, four and five.</p>

<p><i>THE IDIOT'S DELIGHT.</i>&mdash;Here, again, one pack is needed. First, a line
of nine cards is laid out, face up; followed by a line of eight cards; then one
of seven, and others of six, five, four, three, two and one card. This gives
the formation shown in the diagram.</p>

<p>The aim of the player is to get out the four aces and to build upon them,
in proper order and the same suits, until the kings are reached. If this is
managed, the game is a success: if not, a failure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>At the outset, the only cards that can be moved or used in any way are
those shown black in the diagram. They are moved according to the following
plan: a black six goes on a red seven, a red queen on a black king,
and so on. Any number of cards can be placed one on top of the other, if
moved one at a time, but it is not allowable to move a stack of two or more
cards, except to place it in one of the top nine spaces, and then only when
one of these spaces becomes vacant.</p>

<div class="figcenter bigfig">
<img src="images/i_136.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 29.&mdash;The "Lay-Out" for The Idiot's Delight.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Two points remain for explanation:</p>

<p>(1) When one of the cards, shown black in the diagram, is moved, the
card above it comes into play and can be moved.</p>

<p>(2) The "lay-out" does not take all the fifty-two cards. There are seven
over. These can be used for making up sequences as and when desired.</p>

<p>Now, if you can get these three games to work out successfully and do
them the same day, not necessarily the first time you try, frame your wish, a
reasonable one, of course, and await the issue with confidence.</p>

<h2>FORTUNETELLING GAMES</h2>
</div>

<h3>THE ZODIAC WHEEL</h3>


<p>The wheel, illustrated on this page, is divided into a dozen sections, and
each contains a symbol that stands for a Sign of the Zodiac. These signs
greatly influence our lives. We were born under the rule of one of them,
and it is the one that rules our own particular birth-date that we must specially
note.</p>

<div class="figcenter bigfig">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 30.&mdash;The Zodiac Wheel.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To test <em>YOUR</em> luck on almost any question, cut out the wheel and fix it to
a wall or door, by forcing a pin through the center. Do this loosely so that
the wheel will revolve freely when spun in the direction of the arrow. If it
is desired to keep the book intact, copy the wheel on a sheet of stiff paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
The twelve sections are easily provided with the assistance of a pair of compasses
and then the signs must be drawn, as they are done in the illustration.</p>

<p>Before the wheel commences to rotate, blindfold yourself or if you can be
sure of playing fairly, merely close your eyes. Then ask the wheel the
question about which you desire information, and follow by touching the
revolving symbols with some pointed instrument, such as a pencil.</p>

<p>The pencil point will arrest the motion of the wheel and, also, it will touch
one of the twelve sections. Be careful to keep the pencil from moving until
your eyes are opened. Then, note the section which the pencil indicates.</p>

<div class="figcenter bigfig">
<img src="images/i_138.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 31.&mdash;The Oracle</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Take a long pencil, with a point. Place your hand high up above the oracle. Shut your
eyes. Rotate the pencil three times and then bring the point down to the paper. Steady
the pencil and keep it still: then open your eyes. If the pencil point rests within a circle,
the number gives your age when you will be passing through a very lucky period of your
life. If you are more than 20 years of age, add the additional years to the number found
in the circle.</p></div>

<p>This is how the wheel answers your question: The reply is "Yes," if the
pencil touches your Zodiacal month sign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The reply is "Probably yes" if the pencil touches one of the sections on
either side of your Zodiacal month sign.</p>

<p>The reply is: There is a fair chance of the answer being "yes" if the pencil
touches one of the sections two away from your Zodiacal month sign.</p>

<p>The reply is "No" if the pencil touches the section directly opposite to your
Zodiacal month sign. Thus VII is opposite to I, VIII is opposite to II, and
so on.</p>

<p>The other sections give no reading at all.</p>

<h3>YOUR MARRIAGE MONTH</h3>

<p>Here is a very popular game which tells you in which month you should be
married. There are two diagrams. The first is a frame, embellished with
the signs of the Zodiac. Cut out the blank part in the center. The second
diagram consists of two court cards. Cut them out separately, leaving the
signs given on the edges. It will be seen that the two court cards fit into the
Zodiacal frame.</p>

<p>The game is based on the fact that the signs of the Zodiac are very powerful
in watching over people's destinies.</p>

<p>To play this game, place the Zodiacal frame on the table, close your eyes,
and twist the frame round three or four times, or until you have no idea of
the position of the signs. Then, take the two court cards and, while your
eyes are still shut, shuffle them about on the table until you do not know
which is which. Pick up either of them, whichever you prefer, but without
seeing them, and then proceed to fit the card of your choice in the frame.
You will be able to do this by the sense of touch.</p>

<p>When you have set the card in the frame, open your eyes, and examine
what you have done. If any sign on the card is immediately opposite the
same sign on the frame, it indicates the month in which you are most likely
to be married. When two signs on the card pair off with two signs on the
frame, your choice lies between the two months suggested by the signs. On
occasions there will be no signs on the card pairing off with the signs on the
frame. These are the instances when the Fates are undecided. The belief is,
however, that your marriage month is indicated by a sign on the card being
duplicated by the same sign, one position to the right, on the frame. In
saying "to the right," the intention is that the move be made in the same
direction as the motion of the hands of a clock.</p>

<h3>THE DISCS OF FATE</h3>

<p>This is an excellent device for those who enjoy fortunetelling schemes.
There are four discs and they all have to be cut out. While doing this care
must be taken to preserve all the projections intact. Note that the white
center of each disc must be removed. This is fairly easy to do if a pointed
pencil is pushed carefully through the paper.</p>

<p>When the four shapes are ready for use, slip them on to a long pencil, so
near together that they are almost touching. See to it that the disc bearing the
lucky devices is fitted on last. It will then hide the three others. The game
consists in revolving the discs and, while they are turning, there is a likelihood
that they will spread out on the pencil-axis. This can be avoided by slipping
a rubber band on to the pencil in front of the discs, and another behind them.
Leave just enough space for them to revolve comfortably.</p>


<h4>How to Consult the Discs</h4>

<p>Place the arrow projections, one at 3 o'clock, another at 6 o'clock, the third
at 9 o'clock, and the remaining one at 12 o'clock. When all is ready, twirl
your finger three or four times round the disc in the same direction as the
hands travel round a clock face.</p>

<p>Then, when the discs have come to rest, look at the cut-out space in the
disc bearing the lucky symbols. Count up the numbers shown in this space
and consult the lists below. Whatever message is attached to your number,
so is your fate. It is well to remember that if any part of a projection comes
within the disc-space, its particular number counts, whether it can be seen or
not. The fact that the projection is visible is what matters.</p>

<p>You can consult the discs on love, marriage or fortune, but you must decide
which you are engaging before the discs are rotated.</p>

<h3>THE LUCKY SQUARE</h3>

<p>This is a rattling good game for several players. First, give each person a
sheet of paper and a pencil. On the paper, a large square has to be drawn,
such as is used for crossword puzzles. Each side of the square is divided
into six equal portions, and lines are drawn from side to side and from top
to bottom. The figure is now a large square, divided into thirty-six small
squares&mdash;six along any horizontal or vertical row.</p>

<div class="figcenter bigfig">
<img src="images/i_145.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 35.&mdash;The Square required for this game.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The next thing is to exhibit a card on which is printed the following signs
of the Zodiac:</p>

<p class="doubleindent">
<i>ARIES</i><br />
<i>CANCER</i><br />
<i>TAURUS</i><br />
<i>VIRGO</i><br />
<i>PISCES</i><br />
<i>GEMINI</i><br />
<i>LIBRA</i>
</p>

<p>The card is so placed that the players can see the names and refer to them
during the game.</p>

<p>When play starts, the first person chooses any letter he likes, but will probably
select one which helps to spell one of the words set out above. He calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
out the letter and all the players put it in one of the squares on their paper.
That done, the next person selects any letter he chooses, and, on calling it out,
all the players put it in another of the squares. The third person does similarly,
and so do all the other players, until the game is stopped by someone
or until all the thirty-six squares are filled.</p>

<p>The aim of each player is to be the first to spell in consecutive squares,
either horizontally or vertically, one of the names of the signs, as given on
the card. And, naturally, the aim of the other players is to frustrate their
opponents. Obviously, it is forbidden for one person to look at the attempt
of another.</p>

<p>The first player to complete a word cries "stop," and if he is adjudged
correct, he has a wish granted to him.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of skill needed in this game. Suppose the first competitor
selects P as his letter. All the others know he is aiming for "Pisces"
and player No. 2 then calls V. Clearly, he is trying for "Virgo." So player
No. 3 quietly calls A which leaves him free to work on "Aries," "Cancer,"
"Taurus" or "Libra." Now, suppose No. 3 is working for "Aries," in calling,
say I, he helps No. 1 to the I of "Pisces," and so on.</p>


<h3>WHEN IS YOUR WEDDING?</h3>

<p>Several ways are mentioned in this book of finding out which month is to
bring you some particular portion of luck, and here it is proposed to describe
a game of dominoes that tells you the month in which you are to be married.
Nothing is told you about the year of your nuptials&mdash;merely the month, and
it is an amusing game for unmarried people only.</p>

<p>Get out the dominoes and ask an unmarried friend to take a hand with
you. When you have played to the finish, the result will provide one of you
with the name of your marriage month, whichever was previously decided
on. Then, it is usual to play a second game, so that the second of you may
receive enlightenment on the same point.</p>

<p>The game is played in practically the ordinary way that one takes a hand
at dominoes. All the cards from double-six to double-blank are shot on the
table, pips down, and shuffled. Then, each player selects five cards at random
and examines them. The player who is seeking information lays
down any card he or she chooses and then the game consists in matching the
two ends with other cards bearing a number that will match. This is done
by the two players in turn.</p>

<p>If at any point in the game one of the players while still holding a card
cannot match at either end, he or she must draw cards, one by one, from the
heap on the table, until it is possible to match, but one card must always be
left in the heap.</p>

<p>The game ceases when one player has disposed of all his or her cards, or
when the game is shut (i.e., there are no more cards available that will match
seeing that they have all been used) or when neither player can "go" and
there is only one card left in the heap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the game is finished, the pips at the two ends of the formation
are added together, and, whatever the addition happens to be, stands for the
number of the month. Thus, if there is a five at one end and a two at the
other, this gives an addition of seven, and the seventh month is July. It
should be remembered that when a "double" card figures at one end, only
the single number is reckoned; thus the total can never exceed twelve, as two
sixes, one at either end, is the highest possible score.</p>

<p>It will be very quickly appreciated that the thing to avoid is to stop the
game with a blank at both ends. What this means will be perceived by all
players.</p>


<h3>THE GAME OF LUCK</h3>

<p>L stands for Luck, and that is why the track of the game we are now discussing
is arranged in the form of this letter.</p>

<p>The game, shown on the next page, is played by two or more persons and
the scores are decided by throwing a dice, each person taking a turn.</p>

<p>Should any player arrive at one of the sections marked with a cross, he
must go back to the nearest previous station which is a multiple of five; also,
if he alights on a section marked with shaded lines, i.e. 15, 50 and 75, he goes
forward to the next station which is a multiple of five.</p>

<p>The balloons are so arranged that every player must eventually reach one
of them. This is how his luck or fortune is determined:</p>

<p>Whichever balloon is reached, the figures forming it are added up and the
key is given below.</p>

<p>100 = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.&mdash;You are a favored individual, who should find
the world a very pleasant place. You are proud of yourself and your near
relations, and you have a reputation amongst your friends that you value.
Your worst fault is that you are prone to take yourself a little too seriously.</p>

<p>101 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.&mdash;You have a great deal of imagination and are
not slow in recognizing how things will map out in the future. You can
turn your hand to a good number of things and are, thus, a useful member
of society. Your worst fault is that you are prone to believe too much of what
irresponsible people tell you.</p>

<p>102 = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3.&mdash;You are a hard worker and you are likely to
pull your weight in the world. You have an exploring nature and love to
go about and see things. Your worst fault is that you are a trifle domineering
and like to be obeyed.</p>

<p>103 = 1 + 0 + 3 = 4.&mdash;You have a facility for calculating and you
have a head for business especially if figures play an important part. You
are quick in most of the things you do. Your worst faults lie in the direction
of grumbling and gossiping.</p>

<p>104 = 1 + 0 + 4 = 5.&mdash;You have a generous nature and are kindly
and affectionate. In most ways, you are a clear thinker, but you have one
fault. You are extravagant and must have whatever you desire at the moment,
whether you can afford it or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>105 = 1 + 0 + 5 = 6.&mdash;You have a charming personality, pleasing
manners and are entertaining. You are excellent company and make an
admirable friend. You will get on in the world, but, even so, you are not
fond of hard work.</p>

<p>106 = 1 + 0 + 6 = 7.&mdash;You are a careful and patient worker: you
are sincere and conscientious; you have an honest desire to get on in the
world. Your greatest fault is that you lack a sense of humor and are totally
unaware that life has a bright side.</p>

<h3>A GAME FOR "GROWN-UP" PARTIES</h3>

<p>A good deal of fun can be obtained at "grown-up" parties by giving marks
to the various players, according to their merits, as set out in some of the
chapters of this book: then finding out who obtains the highest score and adjudging
him or her the champion of the evening.</p>

<p>The following details are suggested, but they may be, of course, altered
in any way as thought desirable:</p>

<p><i>PALMISTRY.</i>&mdash;First, every player's hand is examined, and the person with
the longest Marriage line is awarded five points. Those with shorter lines
are given four, three, two, one or no points, according to the length of their
Marriage lines.</p>

<p>The same process is then followed in the case of the Heart, Head and
Fate lines.</p>

<p>This accounts for a possible total of twenty marks.</p>

<p><i>BUMPS.</i>&mdash;Second, the players take it in turn to have certain of their
bumps read. For this, the chart of phrenology should be consulted and a
maximum of five points awarded for the best development of the bumps
numbered, on the chart, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8.</p>

<p>This, also, accounts for a possible total of twenty marks.</p>

<p><i>HANDWRITING.</i>&mdash;Third, everybody is given a pen and paper, and
asked to write three or four lines of any passage, taken from a newspaper,
in the usual handwriting. Anyone who obviously disguises or distorts his
or her writing can be dealt a low mark. When all have finished the papers
are examined and assessed according to the hints printed under the heading
"Qualities Shown in Handwriting, Alphabetically Arranged."</p>

<p>The writing is tested for the following:</p>

<p>Accuracy, Generosity, Ingenuity, Logic and Wit. As the papers take a
little time to check, it is advisable for a helper to attend to them while the
next item is progressing.</p>

<p>If five marks are the highest awarded for each test, this will account for
a further twenty marks.</p>

<p><i>THE ORACLE.</i>&mdash;Fourth, turn to the Oracle on p. <a href="#Page_138">138</a>, and allow each
person to rotate the pencil and strike a number, the eyes being shut during
the performance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Give ten points to the player with the lowest score and deduct one point
from ten for each successive score.</p>

<p>This will account for a possible total of ten points.</p>

<p><i>THE ZODIAC WHEEL.</i>&mdash;Fifth, the Zodiac Wheel is set up and each
person, before being blindfolded, states the month in which he or she was
born, and then asks a question. If the wheel answers "Yes," the player receives
ten points; if the reply is "probably yes," then the player is awarded
six points; while four points are given for the answer "there is a fair chance."</p>

<p>Here the game may end or it may be continued, at will, by introducing
further items. If the program we outline is adhered to, the total of possible
marks is eighty.</p>

<div class="figcenter break-before">
<img src="images/i_150.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">

<p>No. 37.&mdash;The Wish-Bone of a chicken will provide some good fun. Two rivals hold a
tip with two fingers; but their fingers must not grasp higher up the shank than indicated
by the arrows. Then they tussle to see who can snap off the larger part of the bone. The
winner frames a wish which, of course, is sure to be granted.</p></div>

<h2>THE LUCK OF WEDDINGS AND MARRIAGES</h2>
</div>


<p>It seems only natural that many superstitions should cluster around a bride
and her wedding day, since from the dawn of civilization, if not the birth
of humanity, all the world has loved a lover. Every act of hers, according
to lore, is fraught with significance and attended by good or evil fortune, and
she is hedged round on every hand by customs and conventions as old as
the hills.</p>


<h3>LUCKY AND UNLUCKY TIMES</h3>

<p>The season of the year is an important consideration. She must avoid
Lent if she hopes for good luck, but the forty days following Easter are supposed
to be extremely fortunate for the celebration of nuptials; and so is
June, which takes its name from Juno, the goddess who is generally regarded
as the patroness of womankind.</p>

<p>If she values her prospects of happiness, a bride will avoid May. The
belief dates from the time of the Romans, who observed the Festival of the
Dead at that time. All other religious ceremonies and observances were
neglected for the time being, even the temples were closed, and those who
contracted matrimony then were considered to be acting in defiance of the
Fates, who revenged themselves on the foolhardy mortals. In Scotland the
feeling against May marriages dates back to the time of that most fascinating
and tragic figure in history, Mary Stuart, who married her third husband, the
Earl of Bothwell, then aroused criticism by wearing blue and white, and
lived so unhappily all the rest of her life. Superstitious people shook their
heads at the temerity of King Alfonso and Princess Ena of Battenberg, who
elected to be married on May 31, and were the objects of a dastardly attempt
on their lives whilst on their way back to the palace.</p>

<h3>THE LUCKY WEDDING DAY</h3>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<h3>MARRIAGE DAY SUPERSTITIONS</h3>

<p>Superstitions and customs vary greatly in different countries and periods,
but they all bear somehow a strong family resemblance.</p>

<p>For instance, one old English proverb runs: "Blest be the bride that the
sun shines on," yet in Germany a bride prays for rain, believing that a new
joy comes with each raindrop, and that then all her tears will be shed before,
and not after, her wedding. There, too, it used to be the custom to take a
lot of old dishes to the door of the bride's house and break them to pieces in
the street, and if by any chance one escaped, it was accepted as a bad omen.</p>

<p>In China, however, when a marriage was being arranged, and any article
of value, such as a vase or a bowl, was broken the ceremony was postponed.</p>

<p>At the wedding feast in Scandinavia someone makes a speech or sings a
song, which ends up in a tremendous noise, and this is the signal for a general
peal of laughter and for the guests to present their congratulations to the
newly-wedded couple.</p>

<p>The Slavs pour a tankard of beer over the bridegroom's horse for luck, and
in the North of England, the maid pours a kettle of hot water over the doorstep
to ensure that another wedding will take place ere long from the same
house.</p>

<p>A curious idea among the Burmese is that people born on the same day of
the week must not marry, and that if they defy the Fates their union will be
marked by much ill-luck.</p>

<p>To prevent these disastrous marriages, every girl carries a record of her
birthday in her name, each day of the week having a letter belonging to it,
and all children are called by a name that begins with that letter.</p>

<p>In New Guinea it is always Leap Year, for in that island the men consider
it to be beneath their dignity to notice women, much less to make overtures
of marriage to them. The proposing is left to the women to do. When a
New Guinea woman falls in love with a man she sends a piece of string to
his sister, or, if he has no sister, to his mother or some other lady relative.</p>

<p>Then the lady who receives the string tells the man that the particular
woman is in love with him. No courting, however, follows. If he thinks he
would like to wed the woman he meets her alone and they arrange matters.</p>


<h3>OMENS OF GOOD OR ILL</h3>

<p>There are so many things for good or ill which the bride herself must or
must not do that she would have a very anxious time keeping them all in
mind if she is very superstitious. These customs begin on the eve of her
wedding, when, for luck, she steps on a chair, and then mounts the table to
ensure good fortune and a rise in the world.</p>

<p>On the morning of the day&mdash;the happy day&mdash;if she should be awakened
by the singing or chirping of a bird, even of a sparrow, or by swallows sweeping
past her lattice at dawn, she may accept these as signs of great good luck.
She must be careful, however, not to break anything, particularly the heel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
her slipper, as such things spell disagreement and trouble with her new relations.</p>

<p>A cat mewing betokens the same undesirable state of affairs, so she would be
wise to see that it has its breakfast in time. If it sneezes, that means the best
of luck.</p>

<p>The bride must not gaze on her reflections, however pleasing, in the mirror,
after she has fully dressed. If she happens to do so, then she must put another
pin in her veil, button her glove, or make some addition to her toilette, to
avert evil consequences. The girl who keeps a pin removed from the bridal
veil is not supposed to get married, and yet in Brittany the girl who secures
one, makes sure of a speedy marriage.</p>

<p>If a small spider is found in the folds of the bridal gown or trousseau, it is
accepted as an excellent sign that money will never be wanting in the family,
but the spider should not be killed: it must be taken out of doors.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances may the bride read or listen to the reading of the
wedding service immediately before the ceremony, not even on the day previous.
She must not try on her wedding ring, and if it falls during the ceremony
woe betide her. It is considered unlucky to pass a funeral on the way
to church, or to meet a monk, a pig, a hare, a lizard or a serpent. On the
other hand, it is a happy omen to encounter a lamb or a dove, as both of
these are emblems of Christ, and the only forms into which the Evil One cannot
enter, according to mediaeval superstition.</p>

<p>A storm of thunder and lightning during the service is regarded as fateful,
and so is an open grave in the churchyard. In entering the church and returning
to her home or the place where the reception is held, the bride should
step with her right foot first. If she sees her groom before he sees her, she
will rule him absolutely, but if he forestalls her glance, then he will be the
master.</p>

<p>The bride and bridegroom are not supposed to meet each other until they
do so at the altar, and in former times a bride did not appear at breakfast, or
even emerge from her room, until she was fully attired and ready to go to
church.</p>

<p>The forward individual who steals the first kiss before the bridegroom has
had a chance to do so is supposed to ensure good luck throughout the year.
It was wont to be the prerogative of the clergyman, but it seems a trifle hard
on the newly-made husband.</p>


<h3>THE ORIGIN OF MARRIAGE CUSTOMS</h3>

<p>Since marriage is usually regarded as the chief event of life, for a woman
at least, and as most women are highly superstitious, it is not surprising to
find that every detail surrounding the auspicious occasion is enveloped in a
web of legendary lore.</p>

<p><i>THE BRIDAL WREATH.</i>&mdash;In ancient times in England bride and bridegroom
alike wore wreaths conserved specially for their use in church, and in
the thirteenth century the bridal chaplet frequently consisted of ears of corn&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>signifying
plenty. Rosemary was considered lucky in Shakespeare's day.
"There's rosemary, that's for remembrance."</p>

<p><i>ORANGE BLOSSOM.</i>&mdash;These spotless blossoms, which betoken purity
and innocence, and are symbolical of a prosperous life, are supposed to have
been first brought by pilgrims from the Holy Land, and thereby possess a
religious significance.</p>

<p><i>THE BRIDE'S VEIL.</i>&mdash;This was originally a fine piece of cloth held over
the couple during the ceremony. Later on it was only held over the bride,
as it was supposed she was more in need of it than her bridegroom, and so it
became part of her attire. In Ireland the old custom still prevails of a sprig
of mistletoe, or a twig of hawthorn, being used to keep her veil in place.</p>

<p><i>THE WEDDING RING.</i>&mdash;Since earliest times the giving or exchanging
of rings cemented any and every contract. Amongst the early Christians, the
thumb and first two fingers typified the Trinity, and the husband placed the
ring on his wife's finger in the threefold Holy name. Some authorities believed
that the third finger of the left hand was connected by a nerve or artery
with the heart, hence its choice for this purpose.</p>

<p><i>THE BRIDE'S CAKE.</i>&mdash;This important part of the wedding feast has
come down to us from the Romans, who baked one compounded of flour,
salt, and water, which was partaken of by the bridal pair and their friends as
they witnessed the wedding contract.</p>

<p><i>THE BRIDE'S DOWRY.</i>&mdash;The phrase "with all my worldly wealth I thee
endow" dates back to primitive times when a man bartered so many head of
cattle for his bride. This money, known as "dow," or "dower," was originally
handed over during the ceremony, and in the course of centuries the bride's
father provided its equivalent either in money or kind.</p>

<p>Later still the bride herself spun the linen for her portion, and was not
regarded as eligible for wifehood until she had stocked a chest with her handiwork.
The term spinster arose in this way, and if a girl's marriage was
delayed until she was of mature age she occasionally sold the contents of her
linen chest and set aside the proceeds as her dowry. The box, with a lid
which is to be found in old-fashioned chests and trunks, was destined as a
receptacle for money thus earned and earmarked.</p>

<p><i>THE GOING AWAY.</i>&mdash;The rice and confetti thrown after the newly-wedded
couple signifies fruitfulness and plenty, and the flowers, usually roses
from which the thorns have been extracted, bestrewing their path denoted
happiness, just as the orange blossom and the myrtle of the bridal bouquet
were emblems of constancy and never-dying love.</p>

<p><i>THROWING OLD SHOES.</i>&mdash;In Anglo-Saxon marriages the bride's father
presented his daughter's shoe to her bridegroom, who touched her on the
head with it to remind her that he was now her master. Then the throwing
of shoes came to be considered a sign of good luck. "Nowe, for goode lucke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
caste an olde shoe after mee." The custom, too, is symbolical of the parting of
the new life from the old, or of shaking the dust of a place from one's feet
and severing all connection with it.</p>

<p><i>A TEAR HANDKERCHIEF.</i>&mdash;In some parts of the Tyrol a beautiful
old custom is still observed. When the bride is starting for the church, her
mother gives her a fine handkerchief, woven for the purpose of the best linen
possible. This is called the "Tear-Kerchief," and with it the girl is supposed
to dry the tears she will naturally shed on leaving home.</p>

<p>After the marriage-day the "Tear-Kerchief" is folded up carefully and laid
in the linen closet, where it remains till its owner's death; then it is taken out
and spread over her face.</p>


<h3>THE BRIDAL DRESS</h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Something old, something new,</div>
      <div class="verse">Something borrowed, something blue.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So runs the ancient rhyme regarding the bride's wedding dress. White is
the popular wear, and has been for several centuries, but previously yellow,
pink, and a brilliant scarlet were frequently chosen, unless by a girl named
Mary, who was expected to wear blue, the Virgin's sacred color. Some years
ago, the daughter of a duke, who was united in marriage to a commoner,
shocked society by insisting on a "green" wedding. In less than a year, she
and her baby were buried in the family tomb.</p>


<h3>WHICH COLOR</h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Married in white, you have chosen aright.</div>
      <div class="verse">Married in green, ashamed to be seen.</div>
      <div class="verse">Married in grey, you will go far away.</div>
      <div class="verse">Married in red, you will wish yourself dead.</div>
      <div class="verse">Married in blue, love ever true.</div>
      <div class="verse">Married in yellow, ashamed of your fellow.</div>
      <div class="verse">Married in black, you will wish yourself back.</div>
      <div class="verse">Married in pink, your spirits will sink.</div>
      <div class="verse">Married in brown, you'll live out of town.</div>
      <div class="verse">Married in pearl, you'll live in a whirl.</div>
</div></div></div>


<h3>THE BRIDEGROOM</h3>

<p>The groom, as the secondary figure in the day's ceremonies, escapes very
easily as far as superstition goes, and may do pretty well what he pleases, save
letting his hat or the ring drop, both of which are very unlucky. He should
carry a tiny horseshoe in his pocket, and fee the clergyman with an odd sum
of money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>No one ought to hand him or his bride a telegram on the way to church,
and if he wishes to be master in his own house, then he must take care to
see her before she has time to catch a glimpse of him ere arriving at the altar.</p>


<h3>MARRIAGE PROVERBS</h3>

<p>Happy is the wooing that's not long in doing.</p>

<p>Marrying for love is risky, but God smiles on it.</p>

<p>The married man must turn his staff into a stake.</p>

<p class="indent">Mary in May, rue for aye.<br />
   Marry in Lent, live to repent.</p>

<p>Advent marriage doth deny, but Hilary gives thee liberty: Septuagesima
says thee nay, eight days from Easter says you may: Rogation bids thee to
contain, but Trinity sets thee free again.</p>

<p>Happy is the bride that the sun shines on.</p>

<p>My son's my son till he gets him a wife.</p>

<p>To change the name and not the letter is to change for the worse and not
the better.</p>

<p>Wedlock's a padlock.</p>

<p>He who marrieth does well; but he who refrains from marriage doth better.</p>


<p class="indent">Needles and pins; needles and pins,<br />
When a man marries, his trouble begins.</p>

<p class="doubleindent">Honest men marry soon,<br />
Wise men not at all.</p>

<p>Marry in haste: repent at leisure.</p>

<p>He who repents him not of his marriage, sleeping and waking, in a year
and a day, may lawfully go to Dunmow and fetch a gammon of bacon.</p>

<p>It will not always be a honeymoon.</p>

<p>Keep your eyes wide open before marriage and half shut afterwards.</p>

<p>Lips, however rosy, need feeding.</p>

<p>Marriage with peace is the world's paradise: with strife, this life's purgatory.</p>

<p>Marry above your match, and you get a good master.</p>

<p>Marry for love and work for silver.</p>

<p>Marriages are made in heaven.</p>

<p>Don't marry for money, but seek where money is.</p>

<p>A man may not wive, and also thrive all in the same year.</p>

<p>Better be half hanged than ill wed.</p>

<p>He that marries for wealth sells his liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>He that marries late, marries ill.</p>

<p>He that is needy when he is married shall be rich when he is buried.</p>

<p>Better have an old man to humor than a young rake to break your heart.</p>

<p>Marry your sons when they will; your daughters when you can.</p>

<p>Marry your daughters betimes, lest they marry themselves.</p>

<p>Two heads are better than one, or why do folks marry?</p>

<h2>FOLKLORE AND SUPERSTITIONS OF THE
MONTHS</h2>
</div>


<h3>JANUARY</h3>

<p>This month is so called in honor of the god Janus, who is always depicted
with two faces or heads, one to look forwards, the other backwards. His
work was to preside over the beginning of any new thing and, ever since his
time, people have invoked his aid and sympathy when they have been setting
out on some new enterprise. On New Year's Day, the Romans gave presents
to one another, much as we do at Christmas, but accompanying the gifts was
usually a small copper token showing the double head of Janus. To possess
one of these tokens ensured prosperity when commencing some new work,
and it was supposed to carry enterprises already started, but not yet finished,
to a successful conclusion. The accompanying illustration gives a reproduction
of one of the tokens used.</p>

<div class="figcenter bigfig">
<img src="images/i_159.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>No. 38.&mdash;Janus, the Two-Headed God. On New Year's Day the Romans gave copper
medallions bearing this device to their friends. To possess such a medallion was a sure
way to be lucky in commencing any new piece of work or any new enterprise.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>NEW YEAR SUPERSTITIONS.</i>&mdash;Endless are the superstitions which
have gathered around the dawn of the New Year, which, although neither a
Christian nor a Church festival, afford sober reflection to many. In several
districts, the custom known as "first-footing" is still common. People wait
until the old year has been rung out and then they call on their friends to wish
them a happy new year. They must not go empty-handed, however, or this
will provide a lean year for the friends. A cake will ensure abundance, a
red herring stands for luck, and the gift of even the smallest coin is a certain
portent that a lucky financial year is opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>While anyone is free to pay these visits, it is much the happiest omen if
the caller be a man, a dark-haired man, and if he takes with him a lump of
coal and a fish. Any fish serves the purpose&mdash;even a tin of sardines. Let
a man, answering these requisites, be the first to cross the threshold of your
door, after the old year has gone, and there is no better way of entering on
the new year.</p>

<p>Another custom, which has many supporters, is to tidy up the house, to
build up the fires and to open wide the front door, just when the old year is
departing. The open door allows the exhausted year to make its exit completely.
It is then supposed to take with it anything savoring of ill-fortune.
The tidy house welcomes the new year in a spirit of brightness and gladness.</p>

<p>For a clock to stop just as the new year is coming in, or to be found to
have stopped then, is an ill omen. Therefore, householders have long been
careful to give an eye to their timepieces some little while before.</p>

<p>Weather-lore regarding the new year is plentiful. Here is a well-known
rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container-left"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">If on New Year's night wind blow south,</div>
      <div class="verse">It betokeneth warmth and growth:</div>
      <div class="verse">If west, much milk and fish in the sea:</div>
      <div class="verse">If north, much cold and snow there will be:</div>
      <div class="verse">If east, the trees will bear much fruit:</div>
      <div class="verse">If north-east, flee it, man and brute.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>January has been described as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container-left"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">The blackest month in all the year</div>
        <div class="verse indent4">Is the month of Janiveer.</div>
      <div class="verse">In Janiveer, if the sun appear,</div>
        <div class="verse indent4">March and April will pay full dear.</div>
      <div class="verse">If January calends be summerly gay,</div>
        <div class="verse indent4">It will be winterly weather till the calends of May.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(The calends, it may be explained, were the first days of the months.)</p>


<p><i>ST. PAUL'S DAY</i> (January 25th)</p>

<div class="poetry-container-left"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">If St. Paul's Day be faire and cleare,</div>
        <div class="verse indent4">It doth betide a happy year:</div>
      <div class="verse">But if by chance it then should rain,</div>
        <div class="verse indent4">It will make deare all kinds of graine:</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">And if ye clouds make dark ye sky,</div>
        <div class="verse indent4">Then meate and fowles this year shall die:</div>
      <div class="verse">If blustering winds do blow aloft,</div>
        <div class="verse indent4">Then wars shall trouble ye realm full oft.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<h3>FEBRUARY</h3>

<p>February derives its name from Februare&mdash;to expiate, to purify. In this
connection, it is interesting to note that on the 2nd of the month falls Candlemas
Day, which is the purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>


<p><i>CANDLEMAS DAY</i> (February 2nd)</p>

<div class="poetry-container-left"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

      <div class="verse">(a) If Candlemas Day be fair and bright,</div>
        <div class="verse indent4">Winter will have another flight:</div>
        <div class="verse indent4">But if Candlemas Day brings clouds and rain,</div>
        <div class="verse indent4">Winter is gone and won't come again.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">(b) If Candlemas Day be fine and clear,</div>
        <div class="verse indent4">Corn and fruits will then be dear.</div>
          <div class="verse indent6">(There'll be twa winters in the year.)</div>
</div></div></div>


<p><i>ST. VALENTINE'S DAY</i> (February 14th).&mdash;Like so many of our old
observances, the festival of St. Valentine dates from the time of the Romans,
but the Church rechristened the custom and called it after one or two
saints of the name, both of whom were martyred, one in the third and the
other in the fourth century.</p>

<p>Latterly, the day has been dedicated to Cupid by fond lovers who believe
it to be the date on which each bird chooses its mate.</p>

<p>The poet Drayton sings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container-left"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Each little bird this tide</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">Doth choose her loved peer,</div>
      <div class="verse">Which constantly abide</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">In wedlock all the year.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Charms and omens are in favor on St. Valentine's Eve. Maidens decorate
their pillows with five bay leaves and firmly believe that, if they dream of
their lover then, they will be married to him in the course of the year. Another
fancy is that the first person of the opposite sex whom one encounters,
that morning is destined to be one's husband or wife. Naturally, there must
be some sort of friendship in view previously.</p>

<p>A weather prophecy regarding February runs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container-left"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">All the months in the year</div>
      <div class="verse">Curse a fair Februeer.</div>
      <div class="verse">February fill the dyke,</div>
      <div class="verse">Weather, either black or white.</div>
      <div class="verse">If February gives much snow,</div>
      <div class="verse">A fine summer it doth foreshow.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In Cornwall, there is a proverb, "A February spring is not worth a pin,"
and the same thought is expressed in Wales by the saying that "The Welshman
had rather see his dam on the bier than to see a fair Februeer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>


<h3>MARCH</h3>

<p>March was given its name by the Romans in honor of Mars, the God of
War, as at this time of the year the weather was such that it enabled them to
begin their campaigns after the worst of the winter was over. The Saxons
called this month <em>LENET MONAT</em>, meaning "length month," in reference to
the lengthening of the days.</p>

<p>Several weather prophecies refer to March:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(a) A peck of March dust and a shower in May<br />
Make the corn green and the fields gay.<br />
<br />
(b) As many mists in March you see,<br />
So many frosts in May will be.<br />
<br />
(c) A peck of March dust is worth a king's ransom.<br />
<br />
(d) March damp and warm<br />
Will do farmers much harm.<br />
<br />
(e) Eat leeks in March and garlic in May,<br />
And all the year after physicians may play.<br />
<br />
(f) March search, April try,<br />
May will prove whether you live or die.<br />
<br />
(g) If on St. Mary's Day (March 25th) it's bright and clear<br />
Fertile 'tis said will be the year.<br />
<br />
(h) A dry and cold March never begs its bread.<br />
<br />
(i) A frosty winter, a dusty March, a rain about Averil, another<br />
about the Lammas time (Aug. 1st), when the corn begins<br />
to fill, is worth a plough of gold.<br />
<br />
(j) March flowers make no summer bowers.<br />
<br />
(k) March winds and April showers bring forth May flowers.<br />
<br />
(l) Whatever March does not want, April brings along.<br />
<br />
(m) On Shrove Tuesday night, though thy supper be fat,<br />
Before Easter Day thou mayst fast for all that.
</p></div>


<h3>APRIL</h3>

<p>The word April is probably derived from the Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aperio</i>, I open, since
spring generally begins and Nature unfolds her buds in this month.</p>

<p>April is regarded as the most sacred month in the calendar of the Church,
since it usually includes Good Friday, on which day blacksmiths once refused
to work owing to the fact that one son of Vulcan made the nails for
the Crucifixion.</p>

<p><i>FIRST OF APRIL.</i>&mdash;The great majority of the old-time customs which
clustered round this day and contributed a dash of gaiety and humor to the
more prosaic, everyday life of the community, have fallen into the limbo of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
forgotten things, and the day is chiefly remembered by schoolchildren, who
exercise their juvenile ingenuity in playing pranks on their fellows.</p>

<p>The most careful research has failed to ascertain the exact origin of these
observances, and someone has hazarded the theory that they began with the
advent of the second man on earth, who sought to try the effects of a practical
joke on the first.</p>

<p>Anyhow, a form of fooling may be traced to the time of the Roman Empire,
but little mention of such a thing is to be found in English literature
until the eighteenth century, although "Hunting the Gowk," the sending of
some half-witted youth, the village idiot, on some utterly absurd errand from
house to house, was long before then a favorite pastime in Scotland, and in
France, too.</p>

<p>A weather prophecy for this day runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container-left"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">If it thunders on All Fools Day,</div>
      <div class="verse">It brings good crops of corn and hay.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>SIMNEL OR MOTHERING SUNDAY.</i>&mdash;It is a very old custom to make
rich cakes during Lent and Easter, which are known as Simnel cakes. In
South Lancashire the fourth Sunday of Lent is known as Simnel or Mothering
Sunday, and young people provide themselves with delicious cakes
"'gainst they go a-mothering." The sons and daughters present these to
their mothers, who in turn regale their families with "furmenty" or "frumenty,"
derived from froment (wheat), as the dish was made of wheat and
milk, with the addition of a few raisins. For children to fail in paying this
compliment to their mothers is sometimes taken as a sign that they will have
no further opportunity of doing so.</p>

<p><i>GOOD FRIDAY.</i>&mdash;It is a misnomer to name the world's blackest Friday
thus, but the words are a corruption of <em>GOD'S FRIDAY</em>. Many quaint and
curious customs are connected with its celebration, the origins of which are
not merely secular but pagan, as well.</p>

<p>For instance, the worship of Terminus, the Romans' pagan god, has still
left its mark on Christian England, where, in certain parishes, the custom
known as "beating the bounds" is still kept up. Terminus decreed that
everyone possessing land should mark the boundaries with stones and pay
honor to Jupiter once a year. Failure to do this would invoke the wrath of
Jupiter and the crops growing on the land would be blighted. Good Friday
or the days previous were marked out for the ceremony.</p>

<p>A wet Good Friday has always been considered favorable for crops, although
people on pleasure bent will think otherwise:</p>

<p>"A wet Good Friday and a wet Easter Day foreshows a fruitful year."</p>

<p>It may be useful to add here a saying about the day previous to Good
Friday; it runs, "Fine on Holy Thursday, wet on Whit-Monday. Fine on
Whit-Monday, wet on Holy Thursday."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p><i>HOT-CROSS BUNS.</i>&mdash;Hot-cross buns may be either a survival of the
sacred cakes offered in the temples to the gods, or of the unleavened bread
eaten by the Jews at the Passover. Bread marked with crosses was common
in ancient Egypt before the days of Christianity. It is an old belief that the
eating of buns on this day protects the house from fire, and other virtues
are ascribed to them. For instance, to eat such a bun grants a wish that you
may be anxious to realize.</p>

<p><i>EASTER.</i>&mdash;This name is derived from <em>Eoster</em>, the goddess of light and
of spring, in whose honor a festival was held in the month of April. Few,
if any of the old customs observed at this time still survive.</p>

<p>Eggs, as being the emblem of the Resurrection, are peculiar to the feast of
Easter, and it is lucky to eat them on the morning of Easter Sunday. At one
time, paschal candles were lit to signify the Resurrection of our Lord. These
were of colossal size, and each church seemed to vie with its neighbor as to
which should have the largest. Easter Sunday was known as Joy Sunday,
and was celebrated by gifts to the poor and the liberation of prisoners. It
was a time when all differences of opinion should be swept aside and
enemies should be forgiven. To harbor enmity against others was to ensure
a time of blackness for oneself.</p>

<p>Many curious customs used to be observed. Most of them have fallen into
decay, but in some parts of the country bouquets in the form of balls are
still presented, and graves are decorated with sweet spring flowers.</p>

<p>Weather observances are numerous:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(a) April weather.<br />
Rain and sunshine both together.<br />
<br />
(b) If the first three days in April be foggy,<br />
Rain in June will make the lanes boggy.<br />
<br />
(c) If Christmas is snow, Easter is mud.<br />
<br />
(d) If Easter is late, there will be a long, cold spring.<br />

</p></div>


<h3>MAY</h3>

<p>Some authorities maintain that the month takes its name from Maia, the
mother of the god Hermes or Mercury; others claim that it comes from
Majores or Maiores, the Senate of the first constitution of Rome.</p>

<p><i>WHITSUNTIDE.</i>&mdash;Whitsuntide, which shares pride of place in the
Church Calendar with Christmas and Easter, is closely connected with the
Jewish feast of Pentecost, which became identified with one of the great
summer festivals of the pagan inhabitants of Western Europe, and this idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
is borne out by the fact that Whitsuntide has always been the most popular
festival period of the year.</p>

<p>It was commonly celebrated in all parts of the country by what was
termed Whitsun ale, which was usually consumed under the auspices of
the churchwardens in some barn near the church, when all assembled agreed
to be good friends for once in the year and spend the day in "sober" joy.</p>

<p>The day was a prolonged picnic, for each parishioner brought what victuals
he could spare. The squire and his lady came with their pipe and
taborer, the young folk danced or played at bowls, and the old looked on
while they sipped their ale, which was brewed fairly strong for the occasion
and sold by the churchwardens for the repairs of the church.</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages, Whitsun services were marked by some curious
customs, one of which was the letting down of a dove from the roof, another
the dropping of balls of fire, of rose leaves, and the like.</p>

<p><i>THE MORRIS DANCES.</i>&mdash;Whitsuntide was pre-eminently the time for
the performance of the Morris dances, which some suppose derive their name
from the Spanish Moriseo, a Moor, and the dance was originally identified
with the fandango. Others believed them to be connected with one of the
season's pagan observances prevalent amongst primitive communities and
associated in some mysterious manner with the fertilization and slaughter
of all living things.</p>

<p>Usually the Morris dances were only performed at special seasons once
or twice a year, and in some districts they were only indulged in at Christmas.
It is highly significant, and bears out the belief in the religious origin
of the movement, that the first of the Whitsuntide dances in some villages
was performed on the top of the tower of the church. Lucky indeed were
those who took part in these church-top revels, for they were certain to be
free of the devil's attentions for some while to come.</p>

</p></div>


<h3>JUNE</h3>

<p>June owes its name to Juno, the goddess of heaven, who takes a special
interest in women and protects their interests. She is supposed to accompany
every woman through life, from the moment of her birth to her death.
Little wonder, then, that the women of ancient times considered that, by
propitiating Juno, their fortunes were assured. This they usually did on
their birthdays.</p>

<p>Midsummer Day (June 24th) is sacred to the memory of John the Baptist,
and the ceremonies practised at this season in the Middle Ages were partly
relics of the saints and partly relics of old sun worship. Great fires of wood
or bones blazed on every mountain top, and were supposed to be typical of
the saint, who was called a burning and a shining light.</p>

<p>These Beltane fires burned often on bare, flat rocks, not only in England,
Scotland, and Ireland, but on the Alps, the Hartz Mountains, and elsewhere.
It was a great thing to be present at or in view of one of these fires,
for the evil spirit was dispelled by the potency of the light and flames.</p>

<p>Rhymes regarding June:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(a) A dripping June<br />
Brings all things in tune.<br />
<br />
(b) If St. Vitus' Day (June 14th) be rainy weather,<br />
It will rain for thirty days together.<br />
<br />
(c) He who bathes in May will soon be laid in clay;<br />
He who bathes in June will sing a merry tune;<br />
But he who bathes in July will dance like a fly.<br />
<br />
(d) Look at your corn in May,<br />
And you will come weeping away:<br />
Look at the same in June,<br />
And you'll sing a merry tune.<br />
(e) June, damp and warm, does the farmer no harm.<br />
<br />
(f) If it rains on Midsummer Eve, the filberts will be spoilt.
</p></div>


<h3>JULY</h3>

<p>This month was so named in honor of Julius Caesar, whose birth-month
it was. The Saxons called it Hey Monat on account of the hay harvest.</p>

<p>The following old sayings regarding July may be noted with interest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(a) A shower of rain in July,<br />
When the corn begins to fill<br />

</p></div>


<h3>AUGUST</h3>

<p>Augustus Caesar, not to be behind Julius, named this month in honor
of himself. He was born in September, and it may seem strange that he did
not bestow his name on that month; but he preferred August as a number
of lucky incidents befell him then, and he gained several important victories.</p>

<p>Rhyming prophecies regarding this month are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(a) If Bartlemy's Day (Aug. 24th) be fair and clear,<br />
Hope for a prosperous autumn that year.<br />
<br />

<br />
(c) Yet there is a saying that "A wet August never brings dearth."<br />
<br />
(d) On St. Mary's Day (Aug. 15th) sunshine<br />

<br />
(i) All the tears that St. Swithin can cry,<br />
St. Bartlemy's dusty mantle wipes dry.
</p>

<p>(St. Swithin's Day is July 15th, and St. Bartlemy's
Day Aug. 24th.)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>


<h3>SEPTEMBER</h3>

<p>September takes its name from the Latin word, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">septem</i>, meaning seven.
It was the seventh month of the year as long as March was constituted the
first month. The Saxons named it Gerst Monat, or barley month, because
they reaped the barley then.</p>

<p>Sayings regarding the month:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(a) If it be fair on the First, it will be fair all the month.<br />
<br />
(b) A wet June makes a dry September.<br />
<br />
(c) September blow soft,<br />
Until the fruit is in the loft.<br />
<br />
(d) If Matthew's Day (Sept. 21st) is bright and clear<br />

cover the fields with snow.<br />
<br />
(i) So many days old the moon on Michaelmas Day (Sept. 29th), so<br />

<br />
(j) Michaelmas chickens and parsons' daughters never come to good.
</p></div>


<h3>OCTOBER</h3>

<p>October is so called from being the eighth month in the old Latin calendar.</p>

<p><i>ALL HALLOW E'EN.</i>&mdash;Hallow E'en, the vigil of All Saints' Day, was
wont to be a season of merry gathering and quaint observances, especially
where lovers were concerned. It is still kept up with great success in
Scotland. Propitious omens were sought. Nuts, for instance, were burnt
in pairs. If they lay still and burned together, it meant a happy
marriage, but if they flew apart, the lovers would not live in harmony. All
sorts of charms were practised. Girls pared apples and sought to discern an
initial in the shape the peel assumed. The apple had to be peeled in one
strip without any break, and the whole strip was then thrown over the left
shoulder. Also, they stuck an apple pip on each cheek, and that which fell
off first indicated that the love of him whose name it bore was unsound.</p>

<p>The customs varied with the locality, but many of them were not unlike
the rites of St. Valentine's Day. Burns's poem enshrined most of the
Scottish practices, such as throwing a ball of blue yarn into a kiln, winding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
it in a new one off the old, and, as the end was approached, the maiden
enquired, "Who holds?" and a voice from the kiln-pot gave her the name
of her future spouse.</p>

<p>Some girls took a candle into a dark room and peered into a looking glass
while they ate an apple or combed their hair, and saw the face of their true
love looking over their shoulder. Others went out into the garden in couples,
hand in hand, with eyes shut, and pulled the first kail-runt or plant they
came to. According to its being big or little, straight or crooked, it was
regarded as prophetic of the kind of man they would marry. If the heart
of the stem was soft or hard, so would be the man's nature, and, if any earth
adhered to the root, it signified "tocher" or fortune.</p>

<p>October prophecies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(a) If October brings much frost and wind,<br />
Then are January and February mild.<br />
<br />
(b) Dry your barley in October and you will always be sober.<br />
<br />
(c) In October manure your field,<br />
And your land its wealth shall yield.<br />
<br />
(d) October never has more than fifteen fine days.
</p></div>


<h3>NOVEMBER</h3>

<p>November was the ninth month according to the old Latin calendar. It
was known as Wint Monat, or wind month, by the Saxons, as the stormy
weather then experienced prevented the Vikings putting to sea and attacking
their shores. It was sometimes called Blot Monat, or blood month, as
it was then customary to kill large numbers of cattle and salt them for
winter use.</p>

<p>November prophecies:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(a) If ducks do slide at Hollantide (Nov. 11th),<br />
At Christmas they will swim.<br />
If ducks do swim at Hollantide,<br />
At Christmas they will slide.<br />
<br />
(b) At St. Martin's Day (Nov. 11th),<br />
Winter is on the way.<br />
<br />
(c) Set trees at Allhallo'n-tide (Nov. 1st), and command them to<br />
grow. Set them at Candlemas (Feb. 2nd) and beg them to<br />
prosper.<br />
<br />
(d) Where the wind is on Martinmas Eve, (Nov. 10th), there it will<br />
be for the rest of the winter.<br />
<br />
(e) If there be ice that will bear a duck before Martinmas (Nov. 11th),<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>there will be none that will bear a goose all the winter.<br />
<br />
(f) Wind north-west at Martinmas (Nov. 11th), severe winter to<br />
come.<br />
<br />
(g) As at Catherine (Nov. 25th), foul or fair, so will be the next<br />
February.
</p></div>


<h3>DECEMBER</h3>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Decem</i> means ten and December was the tenth month of the early Roman
calendar. Probably it has had more names conferred upon it than any other
of the twelve months. Among the Saxons, it was originally Winter Monat,
but after their conversion to Christianity, it was Heligh Monat, or holy
month, in honor of the birth of Christ.</p>

<p>December proverbs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(a) December frost and January flood,<br />
Never boded the husbandman good.<br />
<br />
(b) Frost on the shortest day (Dec. 22nd) indicates a severe winter.<br />
<br />
(c) The day of St. Thomas, the blessed divine<br />
Is good for brewing, baking and killing fat swine.<br />
(St. Thomas's Day is Dec. 21st.)<br />
<br />
(d) Never rued the man that laid in his fuel before St. John<br />
(Dec. 27).
</p></div>

<p><i>CHRISTMAS EVE.</i>&mdash;The Latin Church called Christmas the Feast of
Lights, because Christ, the true light, had come into the world, hence the
Christmas candle and the Yule log, which sometimes were of immense size.</p>

<div class="poetry-container-left"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Now blocks to cleave this time requires,</div>
      <div class="verse">'Gainst Christmas for to make good fires."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the western parts of Devonshire, a superstitious notion prevails that
on Christmas Eve at 12 o'clock the oxen in the stalls are found on their
knees, as in an attitude of devotion.</p>

<p>Mince pies were intended to represent the offerings of the wise men. As
many of the ingredients come from the East, the connection of ideas is plain,
but what can be the origin of the notion that it is desirable to eat mince pies
made by as many different cooks as possible to ensure as many happy months
is not so easily explained. Some authorities are of the opinion that mince
pies were formerly baked in coffin-shaped crusts intended to represent the
manger, but in all old cookery-books the crust of a pie was styled the coffin.</p>

<p>It is said, by those who should be able to speak with authority, that ghosts
never appear on the night of December 24th-25th. This is a fact that
Charles Dickens must have overlooked.</p>

<p>Christmas Proverbs, etc.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(a) A warm Christmas, a cold Easter.</p>

<p>(b) A green Christmas, a white Easter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>(c) Christmas in snow, Easter in wind.</p>

<p>(d) Christmas wet, empty granary and barrel.</p>

<p>(e) If there is wind on Christmas Day, there will be much fruit the
following year.</p>

<p>(f) Snow at Christmas brings a good hay crop next year.</p>

<p>(g) If Christmas falls on a Sunday, there is good luck in store for
all of us.</p>

<p>(h) A child that's born on Christmas Day, is fair, and wise, and
good, and gay.</p>

<p>(i) Carols out of season, sorrow without reason.</p>

<p>(j) If Christmas Day on Thursday be,</p>
      <p class="indent6">A windy winter ye shall see:</p>
        <p class="indent4">Windy weather in each week,</p>
      <p class="indent6">And hard tempest, strong and thick.</p>
        <p class="indent4">The summer shall be good and dry,</p>
      <p class="indent6">Corn and beasts will multiply.</p>


<p>(k) Light Christmas, light wheatsheaf. ("Light" here refers to the
full moon.)</p>

<p>(l) There is a firm belief that to leave Christmas decorations hanging
beyond Twelfth-Night is to bring ill-luck to everybody in the house.</p></div>

<p><i>HOLY INNOCENTS' DAY.</i>&mdash;December 28th was formerly reckoned as
the most unlucky day of the whole year, and few had the temerity to begin
any work or start any new undertaking then.</p>

<p><i>HOGMANAY.</i>&mdash;In Scotland, the night of December 31st is known as
Hogmanay. Then the fire is "rested," and on no account is it allowed to
go out on the hearth, nor is the house swept, nor ashes nor water "thrown
out," in case all the luck should be swept out. "Dirt bodes luck." It is
lucky to give away food or money, to break a drinking glass accidentally,
for a girl to see a man from her window on New Year's morning, and the
birth of a child brings good luck to the entire family.</p>

making a mistake.</p>

Victorian. There must never be as much as a suspicion of flirting.</p>

<p>24.&mdash;He or she will put the home before everything else.</p>

the consideration it deserves.</p>

make the best partner to fit in with your ideals.</p>

<p>18.&mdash;An individual who has a strong will and who, therefore, can do

<p>20.&mdash;Likely to marry late, as you do not feel your position good enough
to share with a partner.</p>

your own station of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>22.&mdash;You can be a delightful companion and ought to make an excellent
husband or wife.</p>

<p>23.&mdash;Your marriage will make a great difference to you, for the better.</p>

<p>24.&mdash;All your love affairs will not bring happiness, but your marriage will
be a success.</p>

<p>25.&mdash;Probably you will marry a person with whom you fell in love at sight.</p>

<p>26.&mdash;Married life will bring considerable happiness, but there will be occasions
when your vanity will be hurt and you will then be somewhat morose.</p>

<p>27.&mdash;You will usually treat your partner with considerable affection, but
there are times when you will speak in a very hasty manner.</p>

<p>28.&mdash;You must be careful whom you marry, as you are not likely to be
too sure of your own mind.</p>

settle down once you meet the right person.</p>

upset your calculations.</p>

<p>14.&mdash;Your partner will appreciate little surprises, such as tokens of your

<p>3.&mdash;Harmless flirtations are hardly harmless, when indulged in by this
person.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;There will be ups and downs in this person's married life, but the
"ups" will exceed the "downs."</p>

<p>5.&mdash;This person will not be rebuffed. If a man, he will not take "no"
for an answer.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;An attractive person with the opposite sex, but likely to cool down

difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>12.&mdash;A person who will take marriage very seriously.</p>

<p>13.&mdash;This individual will play at lovemaking for a long time before treating

the other sex is more or less ignored, followed by a sudden and happy
marriage.</p>

<p>15.&mdash;Liable to delay marriage too long, or until it cannot provide the
blessings anticipated of it.</p>

<p>16.&mdash;Married life will bring many joys and blessings.</p>

<p>17.&mdash;Do not be cold and uncommunicative to your partner. Act as you
did before the wedding.</p>

<p>19.&mdash;As long as your partner is not one given to "laying down the law,"

<p>23.&mdash;Your marriage is likely to have the effect of complicating your financial
position.</p>

<p>24.&mdash;A person who will find married life of average happiness.</p>

<p>25.&mdash;Do not keep from your partner information that should rightly be

<p>26.&mdash;Avoid extravagance in married life and all will be well.</p>

<p>27.&mdash;A kind and generous partner.</p>

<p>28.&mdash;Take little notice of what your friends tell you of your intended one.
Be guided by your feelings alone.</p>

<p>29.&mdash;You will marry late and your only regret will be that you did not
find your partner earlier.</p>

<p>30.&mdash;You and your partner will, largely, keep yourselves to yourselves. You
will be all in all to each other, and it will prove a very happy existence.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>MAKING USEFUL MASCOTS</h2>
</div>


<p>Anyone of a handy disposition can make mascots that will bring luck to
him or herself, as well as to countless friends. In addition, they may be made
for selling at bazaars or even for profit in shops.</p>

<p><i>HORSESHOES.</i>&mdash;As a rule, it is best in this case to obtain a supply of old
and worn horseshoes&mdash;any local farrier will be glad to sell them for a penny
or two apiece&mdash;and to make them presentable. First, knock off the rust, and
then wash them if necessary. It is not a bad plan to beg some old nails from
the farrier, to slip one or two in the holes, here and there of each shoe, and to
twist them round with pliers so that they cannot fall out. Then give the shoes
a coat of paint&mdash;either aluminum or stove-black. When dry, thread a strip of
ribbon of your lucky color through a hole on either side of the shoe, so that
the shoe can be easily hung up. But, please do be careful to arrange the
ribbon so that the shoe can only be hung tips upwards.</p>

<p>Failing a supply of worn shoes, the best idea is to cut horseshoes from a
sheet of thick cardboard. There is an illustration on p. <a href="#Page_horseshoe">6</a> which will give
you an idea of the correct shape to aim at. When the shoes are cut, paint
them with black or silver ink, and tie with ribbon, as already suggested.</p>

<p><i>SWASTIKAS.</i>&mdash;Large swastikas are best cut out of thick cardboard, as
suggested in the previous paragraph for horseshoes, but small ones, suitable
for wearing, are not difficult to cut out of sheet metal, if a triangular file is
at hand for cleaning up the corners and edges. When worn, Swastikas are
usually hung diamond-wise. Therefore, it is necessary to drill a small
hole in one of the corners of the shape. A coat of gold paint or transparent
lacquer will add to the appearance of the finish.</p>

<p><i>SCARABS.</i>&mdash;When scarabs are to be made, the shape with the closed wings
will be found much the simpler to construct. They can be made out of large
oval buttons. If the buttons are flat, it is advisable to give them a domed
surface by applying a suitable layer of plastic wood. This is a putty-like
substance which dries rapidly and which can be moulded to the required shape
with the fingers. When the plastic wood is dry and hard, smooth the surface
with fine glass-paper and ornament it with oil paints. A dull light blue
serves best for the groundwork, and the pattern can be added with a small
brush, using grey or black paint. In this way, some very realistic scarabs can
be made easily.</p>

<p><i>CADUCEUS OR STAFF OF MERCURY.</i>&mdash;This lucky device is very
difficult to make in the form of a model. However, the same purpose can
be served by a picture. Draw the outline in pencil (see p. <a href="#Page_staff">9</a>), give it a wash
of silver color and line in the pattern with India ink. A picture, made in
this way, about twelve inches high, on a white card, would look very attractive
when framed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p><i>ARROWHEADS.</i>&mdash;Those of us who have an eye for geology will have
no difficulty in picking up flints, shaped like arrowheads (see p. <a href="#Page_8">8</a>), along
the sides of country roads. Failing these, we can get some slips of granite,
and, with hammer and chisel, shape them as shown on the page mentioned.
The next thing is to obtain some gilt wire, and to make slings to support the
arrowheads. These can then be hung up or worn, according to their size.</p>

<p><i>TETS.</i>&mdash;These mallet-shaped mascots can be made readily by cutting small
strips of wood to serve as handles, and then moulding the heads in plastic
wood. When the latter has dried hard, all the surfaces are coated with some
bright colored paint, and, after that, additional bands of color are added to
serve as ornamentation (see p. <a href="#Page_tet">8</a>).</p>

<p><i>BLACK CATS AND OTHER DOLL MASCOTS.</i>&mdash;Any woman or girl
who is good at needlework can make cats and doll-shaped mascots fairly
readily. The first thing is to cut a paper pattern of the parts, using newspaper
for the purpose. Usually, it is advisable to make the pattern in no
more than two parts; one for the left side, the other for the right, or one for
the front, the other for the back, according to the way the creature is to be
executed. If this is done, it must be recognized that each part should be
considerably larger than the animal is to appear, since although the pattern
looks as though it need only serve for the front or back, or sides, it really has
to supply the width as well.</p>

<p>When the paper pattern has been suitably shaped, cut out the stuff to
agree with it, allowing an edging for turning in. Use black velvet or black
fur cloth, unless some color is desired. Then, place the two pieces together,
face to face, stitch round most of the edges; follow by turning the outside in
and stuff the interior through the gap of stitches. Old but soft rags do for
the stuffing. When nice and evenly plump, stitch up the gap, taking care to
fold in the seams.

The last stage is to ornament the creature and form its features. Buttons
serve for eyes, stitches of red wool or silk make the mouth and nose, and
whiskers are supplied by hairs taken from a broom. A band of ribbon, tied
in a bow, round the neck, completes the mascot.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
